Assembly Bill No. 857 

[Approved by Governor  July 22, 2016. Filed with Secretary of State  July 22, 2016.] 

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST 

AB 857, Cooper. Firearms: identifying information. 
Existing law authorizes the Department of Justice to assign a distinguishing number or mark of identification to any firearm 
whenever the firearm lacks a manufacturer's number or other mark ofidentification, or whenever the manufacturer's number or 
other mark of identification or distinguishing number or mark assigned by the department has been destroyed or obliterated. 
This bill would, commencing July 1, 2018, and subject to exceptions, require a person who manufactures or assembles a firearm 
to first apply to the department for a unique serial number or other identifying mark, as provided. The bill would, by January 1, 
2019, and subject to exceptions, require any person who, as ofJuly l, 2018, owns a firearm that does not bear a serial number to 
likewise apply to the department for a unique serial number or other mark of identification. The bill would, except as provided, 
prohibit the sale or transfer of ownership of a firearm manufactured or assembled pursuant to these provisions. The bill would 
prohibit a person from aiding in the manufacture or assembly of a firearm by a person who is prohibited from possessing a 
firearm. The bill would make a violation ofthese provisions a misdemeanor. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a 
state-mandated local program. 
The bill would require the department to issue a serial number or other identifying mark to an applicant meeting specified criteria 
and would allow the department to charge a fee to recover its costs associated with assigning a distinguishing number or mark 
pursuant to the above provisions. 
This bill would make a conforming change. 
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the 
state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. 
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
