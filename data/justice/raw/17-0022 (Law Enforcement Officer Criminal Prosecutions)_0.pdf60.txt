ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE 

WHEREAS,  the  State of California is  home to  over 1,000 law enforcement agencies including  local  police 
departments, sheriff's departments, and the California  Highway Patrol,  which  employ peace officers in 
each agency ("Law Enforcement Officers"); 

WHEREAS, we  the people,  through our Constitution and  state and  local laws,  have granted  Law 
Enforcement Officers the right to  use lethal and  near-lethal force to defend the Constitution and to enforce 
laws protecting the welfare,  safety,  and  health  of the public; 

WHEREAS,  Law Enforcement Officers are required to  undergo highly specialized training which  includes, 
amongst other topics,  situational and/or hands-on  use of force training. 

WHEREAS,  an  essential  duty for Law Enforcement Officers is to  keep the  peace in  accordance with their 
highly specialized training; 

WHEREAS,  The  United States Supreme Court has ruled that deadly forced  may not be  used,  unless an 
individual poses a significant threat of death or serious bodily harm  to one's self or others; 

WHEREAS,  the standard  of reasonableness required  of Law Enforcement Officers in  criminal 
prosecutions involving  lethal or near-lethal  use of force in  defense of self or others has  not been altered 
from that of an  ordinary citizen  by  law or legal  precedent; 

WHEREAS,  the standard  of reasonableness required  of Law Enforcement Officers in  criminal 
prosecutions involving  lethal or near-lethal  use of force in  defense of self or others should  necessarily be 
higher than  that which  is  required  for an  ordinary citizen to  prevail on  a theory of self-defense; 

WHEREAS,  law enforcement officers are servants of the citizenry and  cases  involving excessive, 
unwarranted,  or improper use of force  are of critical  importance to  the  public at large and the members of 
the affected  communities in  particular; 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  BE  IT RESOLVED that: 

1.  Notwithstanding any  previous statutory and/or case  law to  the contrary,  in  criminal  prosecutions 
involving the  use of lethal or near-lethal force,  law enforcement officers shall  be  held to a reasonable 
person  standard  that is - both  in  theory and  in  practice - equal to or higher than  that required  for an 
ordinary citizen to  prevail on  a self-defense claim. 

2.  Any criminal  prosecution  of a law enforcement officer for a crime related  to  abuse of power or authority, 
unlawful or excessive use of force  under color of law,  or a violent felony whether or not under color of law, 
shall  not be  heard  in  a bench trial  but  must be  heard  before a jury. 

In  accordance with  California  Elections Code§ 9001 (a),  we,  the  proponents,  hereby submit the following 
draft of our proposed  Constitutional Amendment initiative measure and  request that a circulating  title and 
summary of the  chief purpose and  points of the proposed  initiative measure be  prepared.
