THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF  CALIFORNIA DO  ENACT AS FOLLOWS: 

SECTION  1. 

Division 38 (commencing with Section 86000) is  added to the Water Code, to read: 

DIVISION  38. State water supply infrastructure, water conveyance, ecosystem and watershed  protection 
and  restoration, and drinking water protection act of 2018. 

CHAPTER  1. Short Title. 

86000. This division shall  be  known and  may be  cited as  the Water Supply and  Water Quality Act of 2018. 

CHAPTER  2. Findings and Declarations. 

86001. The  people find and declare the following: 

(a)  In our frequently very dry state, our high-tech, agricultural and  urbanized economy relies on an 
uninterrupted and  high-quality water supply. By making water use more efficient, reducing the demand 
for water, providing new and  diverse water supplies, improving the quality of our source watersheds, and 
protecting key environmental uses of water, this measure will assure that the economic and 
environmental engines of California are  not derailed by a shortage of water. 

(b) California's recent historic drought raises serious questions about the Jong-term  reliability of our 
current water supplies. The drought underscores the need to use our existing water supplies more 
efficiently, increase investments in  our water infrastructure, and more effectively integrate our water 
system from the headwaters to the end  user. 

(c)  California's water situation requires implementation of the Governor's Water Action  Plan to provide 
for the water needs ofpeople, agriculture and the environment. This division will help provide a more 
reliable water supply by reducing waste, increasing the amount of water available to meet our needs, and 
improving water quality. This division also  provides additional protection for our communities from 
floods. 

(d) This division will implement cost effective methods of water development and conservation to meet 
California's present and future water needs in a changing climate, including capture of urban drainage 
and stormwater runoff, groundwater and  brackish water desalting, groundwater storage, water recycling, 
waterconservation, and watershed  management, restoration, enhancement and protection. 

(e)  Many of the water supply and  water quality investments provided by this division will be matched by 
agencies and grant recipients, more than doubling the effectiveness of the funding provided. 

(f) Agencies implementing this division will give high  priority to cost-effective projects, and to the most 
durable and  most environmentally beneficial projects. Funding will go to projects that contribute to 
implementation of the Governor's Water Action Plan, the goal of which  is to increase the resiliency of the 
California water system and the ability of California communities to cope with drought conditions. 

1 

(g)  Every Californian  has a right to safe, clean, affordable, and  accessible drinking water. By  complying 
with Section 106.3, agencies providing funds for safe drinking water pursuant to this division will help 
achieve the intent of that Section. 

(h) This division provides a fair and  reasonable distribution of funds directly and  indirectly benefitting 
every region  of the state. 

(i) This division provides short and  long-term cost-effective actions to address the water shortages caused 
by the recent drought, and will help prepare local communities for future droughts. Droughts reduce 
water supplies for people, agriculture and the environment. This division will help meet the water needs 
of people, agriculture, and the environment and  make California  more resilient in the face of a changing 
climate. 

(j)  By improving the health and water productivity of watersheds, communities will become more selfÂ­
reliant with respect to water supply, and  local environmental quality will be increased. 

(k)  By removing invasive plants such as yellow starthistle, giant reed  (Arundo donax)  and tam a risk, water 
supply will be increased and  habitat for fish and wildlife will be improved. 

(I)  Flooding can  devastate communities and  infrastructure. We can make better use  of floodwaters by 
capturing waters and putting them to use  in  our communities, on our farms, and  by recharging 
groundwater basins.  By providing funds to intelligently manage our watersheds and floodplains, this 
division will also  help avoid flood damage, improve fish  and wildlife habitat, remove  pollutants from our 
water supply, enhance groundwater, remediate aquifers and  improve the environment.  Better floodplain 
management may allow improved operation of upstream reservoirs for water supply purposes. 

(m) Severe fire conditions can  lead to significant erosion, reduced  water quality and  impacts on water 
infrastructure. This division provides funding to manage forests and  watersheds to reduce fire danger, 
mitigate the effects of wildfires on water supply and quality, and  enhance water supplies. 

(n) This division funds the following programs, which respond to human and  environmental water needs 
in California: 

(1)  Improvement of water supply and  water quality utilizing cost effective methods, including 

water conservation, desalting of groundwater and  other inland saline water, stormwater management, 
wastewater recycling, and similar water management measures. 

(2)  Better management of forest and  rangeland watersheds, such  as through the Sierra  Nevada 

Watershed Improvement Program to improve the pattern, quantity and  quality of water runoff and 
groundwater recharge. Improving soil  health  improves the ability of the ground to better contain 
groundwater and  moderate the rate of water runoff. 

(3)  Better groundwater management, including faster implementation of the Sustainable 

Groundwater Management Act, and  better recognition of the connection between surface and 
groundwater. 

(4)  Provision of water for fish and  wildlife, including restoration of the Pacific Flyway and 

management of habitat in a dynamic way to respond to changing environmental conditions. 

2 

(5)  Increased capacity to convey water resulting in greater groundwater recharge and  improved 

conveyance and  utilization of floodwaters for use in  drought years. 

(o) The State Water Resources Control  Board, the  Department of Fish  and Wildlife, and  many other 
agencies have recognized that providing funding for fish  habitat enhancement is vital to restoring native 
California fish  populations, and that relying solely on flow to restore those populations will not be 
sufficient. Providing funding for fish  habitat enhancement is  a vital complement to reasonable flows to 
protect fish. 

(p) California has lost ninety-five percent (95%) of its historical wetlands. These wetlands provide food, 
water and cover for migratory and  other birds, fish,  mammals, reptiles, amphibians and  a vast number of 
plant species.  Many species may become endangered or threatened without wetlands and  many more 
survive only due to wetlands available today. This division combines work to sustain and  protect current 
wetlands with the potential to increase  wetlands in California to support a thriving flora and fauna. 

(q) The implementation of this division will result in cost savings to local governments immediately by 
substantially more than one  billion dollars, and  reduce  local government operating costs by hundreds of 
millions of dollars per year. This division will provide funding that displaces local government funding, 
resulting in the implementation of projects in the following areas. These  projects would  have eventually 
been implemented by local government. 

(1) Safe  Drinking Water. State direct and  matching funds will reduce the cost to local government 
of implementing drinking water and  wastewater treatment systems, and to some extent the operation of 
those systems. 

(2)  Wastewater recycling. State funds will reduce the cost of these plants, reducing the capital 

cost of the projects for local governments.  By  reducing local government capital costs, the cost of water 
from these plants will also be  reduced.  Implementation of wastewater recycling plants will defer the need 
for more expensive alternative sources of water supply, thus further reducing local capital and  operating 
costs. 

(3) Groundwater desalting. State funds will reduce the cost of these plants, reducing the capital 
cost of the projects for local governments. By reducing local government capital costs, the cost of water 
from these plants will also be  reduced.  Implementation of groundwater desalting plants will defer the 
need for more expensive alternative sources of water supply, thus further reducing local capital and 
operating costs. 

(4)  Water Conservation. State funds will reduce the cost of these projects, reducing costs to local 

government. More importantly, reduced  water demand  resulting from these projects will reduce 
operating costs, and will temporarily or permanently defer the construction and  operating costs of more 
expensive capital outlay projects needed to provide new water. 

(5)  Repairing flood control reservoirs. State funds will reduce the costs of these  projects for local 

government. 

(6) San  Francisco Bay Restoration Authority funds. State investment in wetlands projects 

providing flood  protection around San  Francisco  Bay will reduce flood  risk associated with climate change. 
This will reduce the cost of other flood control measures, and more importantly will reduce flood damage 
which often results in tremendous costs to local government for facility repair. 

3 

(7) Stormwater funding.  Regulations imposed by the State Water Resources Control Board and 

various regional water quality control boards will result in the construction of various capital outlay 
projects costing billions of dollars.  Providing funds through this measure will reduce the cost of these 
projects to local government. 

(8)  Fisheries restoration. This division provides hundreds of millions of dollars for fisheries 

restoration.  Local and  regional water agencies are voluntarily undertaking many of these projects. By 
providing state funds, this division will reduce local costs.  In addition, the resulting increase in fish 
populations will make it possible to improve local water supplies, avoiding local government costs to 
provide replacement water supplies costing hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. 

(9)  Bay Area  Regional  Reliability. Bay Area water districts are  undertaking extensive 

improvements in their water distribution systems to interconnect their water supplies for greater drought 
water supply reliability and other benefits.  By providing funds for this program, this division will reduce 
their costs by two hundred and  fifty million dollars ($250,000,000). 

(10) Friant Kern Canal  Repair. Groundwater overdraft has caused subsidence of the Friant Kern 
Canal. State funds to repair the canal  will reduce the cost of repairing the canal to local water districts. 
Avoiding the cost to finance this project will also save tens of millions of dollars per year in interest costs 
which would have to be  paid by these districts. 

(11) Oroville Dam  Repair. Although the costs of repairing Oroville Dam should  be covered by the 

federal government either through the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Corps of 
Engineers, the federal government may not fulfill this obligation. If the State Water Resources 
Development System contractors, all  local agencies, are forced to cover all or part of these costs, this 
division will reduce their costs by two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000}. Interest costs would also 
be  reduced. 

(r) Substantial funds remain to be  allocated to storage projects pursuant to Division 26.7.  For this reason, 
and so  as not to interfere with the work of the California Water Commission in  awarding these funds, this 
measure does not include funding for the construction of specific storage projects.

CHAPTER  5.3. Water Conservation. 

86030. The sum of three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) is appropriated from the Fund to the 

10 

department for the following purposes: 

(a) Statewide turf removal program. 

(1) The  program shall provide financial incentives to public and  private property owners to 

convert their irrigated or watered landscaping to drought tolerant plantings, including appropriate low 
water using plants. The department shall set a maximum amount each  applicant can  receive, and shall 
allow greater incentives to low-income homeowners who could  not otherwise afford to participate in the 
landscape water conversion program. No  less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the funds allocated to 
this program shall be spent on  programs benefitting residential property owners. The  department shall 
make awards to nonresidential applicants on the basis of cost-effectiveness with respect to water supply. 
Each  grant must reduce water consumption by at least fifty percent (50%) compared to current water 
use. 

(2) The most cost-effective projects and those projects that provide the greatest environmental 
benefits based on the state investment shall  receive  highest priority for funding.  Environmental benefits 
shall include, but not be  limited to, planting appropriate drought resistant native and  other plants, 
reduction in consumptive water use, and  increased availability of water for environmental benefits. 

(3) The department shall not reject or reduce eligibility to residents residing in service areas 

which have previously offered turf removal rebate programs as long as the  resident was  not a participant 
in the program. 

(4) The department shall cooperate with eligible entities as  defined in subdivision (a) of Section 
86166 and the California  Public Utilities Commission to develop an  on-bill repayment mechanism to pay 
for the consumer's share of the landscape conversion project. 

(b)  Leak detection. 

(1) Competitive grants on a matching basis to public water systems to reduce  leaks in their water 
distribution systems, eliminate leaks in the water systems of their customers if the water system operator 
determines that customer leak detection and  elimination is a cost-effective way to improve the water

(i) Of the amount appropriated pursuant to this section, five million dollars ($5,000,000) shall be available 
to assist in the development of the Central Valley Salmon  Partnership Habitat Implementation Plan. 

(j) The Secretary shall give high priority to the removal of Dennett Dam  on the Tuolumne River,  if 
additional funds are still needed to complete removal of the Dam. 

(k)  A local public agency,  Indian tribe or nonprofit organization receiving funding under this chapter may 
use  up to twenty percent (20%) of those funds to establish a trust fund, the proceeds of which shall  be 
used exclusively to pay or help pay for the maintenance and  monitoring of the project being funded. 

(1)  If the local public agency,  Indian tribe or nonprofit organization  is unable to continue to 

maintain and  monitor the project, it may transfer ownership of the trust fund to another public agency, 
Indian tribe or nonprofit organization, with the approval of the Secretary of the Natural Resources 
Agency. 

(2) This subdivision does not apply to state agencies. 

(3)  If the local public agency,  Indian tribe or nonprofit organization does not establish a trust fund 

pursuant to paragraph (1), the agency, tribe or organization shall certify to the Secretary of the Natural 
Resources Agency that it can  maintain the project from funds otherwise available to the agency, tribe or 
organization. 

(4)  If all  or part of the project cannot be  maintained or is condemned, the trust fund and any 

unexpended interest are appropriated to the California  Natural Resources Agency. The  funds returned to 
the Agency may be  utilized only for projects pursuant to this chapter. 

(I)  Of the amount appropriated to the California Natural Resources agency pursuant to this section, seven 
million dollars ($7,000,000) is  appropriated to the Department of Fish and Wildlife for native fish 
restoration  projects on the upper Feather River below Oroville dam  for gravel restoration, stream bed 
restoration, and  salmon habitat restoration projects. 

CHAPTER  7. Groundwater Sustainability and Storage. 

86110. (a) The sum of six hundred seventy-five million dollars ($675,000,000) is appropriated from the 
Fund to the department for projects and  programs that support sustainable groundwater management 

30 

consistent with Part 2.74 of Division 6 (commencing with Section 10720). The funds shall  be  used for 
competitive grants that advance sustainable groundwater management through implementation of 
groundwater sustainability plans and  projects that protect, enhance, or improve groundwatersupplies. At 
least ten percent (10%)  of all grants made pursuant to this paragraph shall  be  made to groundwater 
sustainability agencies whose groundwater basins underlie disadvantaged communities. 

(b) The  sum  of ten million dollars ($10,000,000) is  appropriated from the fund to the State board, for use 
by the Office of Sustainable Water Solutions to implement a multidisciplinary technical assistance 
program for small and  disadvantaged communities, and  support the involvement of disadvantaged 
communities and  the public in groundwater sustainability agencies and  in the development and 
implementation of groundwater sustainability plans. 

86111. (a)  Of the funds authorized by section 86110, six  hundred forty million dollars ($640,000,000) shall 
be available for grants to groundwater sustainability agencies implementing groundwater sustainability 
plans pursuant to subdivision (k) of Section 10721 for the following purposes: 

(1) Groundwater recharge and  storage projects including but not limited to acquisition of land 

and groundwater pumping allocations from willing sellers,  planning of facilities such as feasibility studies 
and  environmental compliance, distribution systems, and  monitoring facilities.  No grant made pursuant 
to this section shall exceed twenty million dollars ($20,000,000). 

(2)  Projects that implement groundwater sustainability plans pursuant to Part 2.74 of Division 6 
(commencing with Section 10720). Projects eligible for funding include but are not limited to feasibility 
studies, environmental compliance, engineering work used to develop groundwater use and  sustainable 
yield for specific projects, well use  measurement and innovative decision support tools. 

(3)  Projects that assess and  address saltwater intrusion including future impacts related to 

climate change. 

(4)  Matching grants to groundwater sustainability agencies to develop groundwater sustainability 
plans pursuant to subdivision (k) of Section 10721. No grant shall exceed one million dollars ($1,000,000), 
and  no groundwater sustainability agency shall receive  more than one grant. 

(b)  Of the funds authorized by this section, the sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000) shall be  available 
for research to guide investments made pursuant to this section.  Research activities may include, but are 
not limited to, geophysical surveys, system-level modeling and  analysis, development of novel methods 
and tools that can  be  applicable to local decision-making, cross-sector economic and  policy analysis of 
novel recharge  methods, and  development of new approaches to significantly enhance groundwater 
recharge and fit-for-purpose watertreatment and  reuse. 

(c)  Of the funds authorized by this section, the department may allocate up to ten million dollars 
($10,000,000) for the development of publicly accessible  decision support tools to assist groundwater 
sustainability agencies in conducting drinking water quality analysis, including the development and 
assessment of sustainable yield, undesirable results,  measurable objectives and  other required targets. 
The decision support tools should also support vulnerability assessments to help determine communities 
that may be  at risk of facing water supply or contamination challenges. The  tools should be available for 
other efforts such as  drought vulnerability assessments and shall be  linked to the Human Right to Water 
indicator housed  at the State board. 

31 


(d)  Of the funds authorized by this section, the department may allocate up to five million dollars 
($5,000,000) for one or more grants for capital outlay and  related programmatic purposes to institutions 
of higher education for facilities that can  be  used to improve communication and coordination among 
these institutions, the department and the State board  in order to assure that developments in 
groundwater science and  management are efficiently deployed and  employed across higher education 
institutions and state government agencies. 

(e)  A local public agency, Indian tribe or nonprofit organization receiving funding under this section may 
use  up to twenty percent (20%)  of those funds to establish a trust fund  used exclusively to pay or help pay 
for the maintenance and  monitoring of the agency's or organization's interest in  land  acquired pursuant 
to th isÂ· section. 

(1) If the local public agency, Indian tribe or nonprofit organization that acquired an  interest in 

land  with money from this section decides to transfer that interest to another public agency, Indian tribe 
or nonprofit organization, the ownership of the trust fund  established to maintain that interest in land 
shall also  be transferred. 

(2) This subdivision does not apply to state agencies. 

(3)  If the local public agency,  Indian tribe or nonprofit organization does not establish a trust fund 
pursuant to this subdivision the agency, tribe or organization shall certify to the state agency making the 
grant that it can  maintain the land to be  acquired from funds otherwise available to the agency, tribe or 
organization. 

(4)  If the interest in  land is condemned or if the local public agency,  Indian tribe or nonprofit 

organization determines that the interest in  land is unable to fulfill the purposes for which money from 
this chapter was expended, the trust fund and any unexpended interest are appropriated to the agency 
that provided the money. The funds returned to the agency may be  utilized only for projects pursuant to 
this chapter. 

86112. (a) The department shall give priority for funding pursuant to this chapter to the following in equal 
priority: 

(1) Groundwater basins designated  by the department as critically overdrafted basins, 

groundwater basins which are  in  danger of becoming critically overdrafted, and groundwater basins 
where surface and groundwater are  interconnected. 

(2) Groundwater basins with documented water quality problems, land subsidence, impacts on 

surface streams or groundwater dependent. ecosystems, or other undesirable results as defined by 
subdivision (x)  of Section 10721. 

(3)  Groundwater basins that protect important state-owned resources, such as  state parks and 

wildlife areas. 

(4)  Projects that support the use of floodwaters of acceptable water quality to recharge 

groundwater basins. This  innovative multi-benefit concept brings together four important California 
water management objectives, including flood hazard  reduction, sustainable groundwater 
management, ecosystem restoration, and  water supply reliability. 

32 


(A)  Projects may include adaptive modification of flood and  conservation storage operations 

at reservoirs, modifications to spillway facilities at existing reservoirs, inundation of new or expanded 
flood bypasses or temporary flood storage land areas, application of floodwaters to agricultural lands 
during fallow or dormant seasons, or increased  use of existing groundwater recharge facilities. 

(B)  Projects may include using floodwaters for recharge of groundwater projects, with both 

flood hazard  reduction and groundwater sustainability benefits. 

(C)  Projects that provide benefits in flood hazard  reduction and groundwater sustainability. 

Project feasibility can also be  supported by ecosystem  restoration and water supply benefits. 

(b) Of the amount appropriated in section 86110, the department may use  up to ten million dollars 
($10,000,000) for the following purposes: 

(1) Assess statewide potential for use of floodwaters for recharge and  prioritize locations based 
upon proximity and conveyance connections in the State with flood  hazard reduction and groundwater 
sustainability needs. 

(2) Complete a pilot study of a priority location to demonstrate potential water resources 

management innovations to facilitate flood  hazard reduction and  groundwater recharge. 

(3)  Identify and demonstrate use of analytical tools and  innovative water management 

techniques to support development of available floodwaters and  recharge of groundwater basins. 

(4)  Develop economic monetization techniques of groundwater recharge benefits. 

(5)  Demonstrate application of the department's climate change methodology to both water 

supply and flood management applications. 

(6)  Provide technical assistance to groundwater sustainability and  local flood  management 

agencies,  as well as coordination with state and federal flood agencies. 

(c) The  department shall consider the following criteria  when awarding grants: 

(1) The  potential of the project to prevent or correct undesirable results due to groundwater use. 

(2) The  potential of the project to maximize groundwater storage, reliability,  recharge or 

conjunctive use. 

(3) The  potential of the project to support sustainable groundwater management. 

(4) The annualized cost-effectiveness of the project to achieve the goals of the Sustainable 

Groundwater Management Act, Chapter 2.74 of Division 6 (commencing with Section  10720). 

(d)  Eligible entities as  defined in subdivision (a) of Section 86166, including groundwater sustainability 
agencies, shall  be  eligible for grants.  Priority for funding shall be given to local agencies implementing the 
Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. 

33 

(e)  For purposes of awarding funding under this chapter, a local cost share of not less than fifty percent 
(50%)  of the total cost of the project shall  be  required. The cost-sharing requirement may be  waived or 
reduced for that portion of a project that directly benefits a disadvantaged community or economically 
distressed area, or for projects the majority of whose benefits are to restore ecosystems dependent on 
groundwater. 

(f) No grant may be made unless the Department of Fish  and Wildlife certifies that harm done to fish  or 
wildlife as a result of the project will be mitigated to ensure any potential impacts are  less than 
significant. 

(g)  Eligible projects may include such infrastructure improvements such as  improved canal and  infiltration 
capacity. 

86113. (a)  For purposes of this section, "District" means the Borrego Water District. 

(b) Of the amount appropriated in Section 86110, thirty-five million dollars ($35,000,000) shall be 
awarded as a grant to the District for the following programs: 

(1)  Acquisition of land and acquisition of the right to pump groundwater from willing sellers to 

reduce groundwater pumping in order to bring groundwater pumping within the boundaries of the 
Borrego Springs Subbasin of the Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin to a level that is  sustainable on  a longÂ­
term basis pursuant to the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act,  Chapter 2.74 of Division 6 
(commencing with Section 10720). Lands acquired may be transferred to the Department of Parks and 
Recreation, a nonprofit organization or another public agency for future management. 

(2) Water end-use efficiency, including urban and agricultural water conservation, and water 

conservation on recreational facilities such as golf courses. 

(3)  Restoration of lands acquired pursuant to this section. 

(4) Stormwater capture for groundwater basin  recharge and  re-use. 

(5) other District projects implementing the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act. 

(c)  (1)  No cost sharing by the District is required to implement this section. This is justified because the 
community of Borrego Springs is a severely disadvantaged community, and  because  excessive 
groundwater pumping can  impact important resources  in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park whose 500,000 
annual visitors contribute an  estimated forty million dollars ($40,000,000) annually to the region, as well 
as support 600 jobs. 

(2) The  District may require cost sharing by beneficiaries when  making grants pursuant 

paragraphs (2) and  (4) of subdivision (b). 

(d)  As a condition of this grant, the District must agree to: 

(1)  Implement measures which assure that lands not presently being irrigated will not come into 

irrigation, and that presently irrigated lands will not become more intensively irrigated; and 

34 

(2)  Require new development to  pay all costs of water purchases the District incurs, and  all costs 

of water projects the District undertakes in order to accommodate that development. 

(e)  (1) The  District or a nonprofit organization that receives funding pursuant to this chapterto acquire an 
interest in  land may use  up to twenty percent (20%) of those funds to establish a trust fund that is 
exclusively used to help pay for the maintenance, monitoring and restoration of that interest in  land. 

(2) The  District or a nonprofit organization that acquires an  interest in  land with money from this 

chapter and transfers the interest in  land to another public agency or nonprofit organization shall also 
transfer the ownership of the trust fund that was established to maintain that interest in land. 

(3) This subdivision does not apply to state agencies. 

(4)  If the District or nonprofit organization does not establish a trust fund  pursuant to this 

subdivision, the agency or organization shall certify to the department that it can maintain the land to be 
acquired from funds otherwise available to the agency or organization. 

(5) If the interest in  land is condemned or if the District or nonprofit organization determines that 
the interest in  land  is unable to fulfill the purposes for which money from this chapter was expended, the 
trust fund and any unexpended interest are appropriated to the District. The  funds returned to the 
District may be  utilized only for projects pursuant to this chapter. 

(f) Any funds not needed  by the District to implement the program described in this section may be 
granted by the District to a nonprofit organization or the California  Department of Parks and Recreation 
to acquire lands adjacent to or in the immediate proximity of Anza-Borrego Desert State  Park to prevent 
development or irrigation of that land which might impact groundwater resources in the Park. These 
lands may be  inside or outside the boundaries of the District, but must be within the boundaries of the 
Borrego Springs Subbasin of the Borrego Valley Groundwater Basin, which is the source of all potable 
water for the Borrego Springs community and visitors to the Park. The  lands may be  used  for wildlife 
habitat. 

(g) The  District may award grants to nonprofit organizations in order to carry out all or part of the 
programs authorized by this section. 

CHAPTER 8.  Water for Wildlife, Pacific Flyway Restoration, and  Dynamic Habitat Management. 

86120. The sum of three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) is appropriated from the Fund to the 
Wildlife Conservation Board  (hereinafter in this section "the Board") to acquire water from willing sellers 
and to acquire storage and delivery rights to improve conditions for fish and wildlife in streams,  rivers, 
wildlife refuges, wetland  habitat areas and  estuaries. High priority shall  be given to meeting the water 
delivery goals of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (Title 34 of Public Law  102-575). The  Board 
may arrange for acquisition, long-term lease agreements, or transfer of water rights if it determines such 
actions are  beneficial to wildlife conservation. The  Board  may sell, transfer, or store water or storage 
rights purchased  pursuant to this section, if the Board finds that the sale, transfer or storage will not 
cause  harm to fish and  wildlife. In years when the Board  does not require the water for fish  and  wildlife 
purposes, the Board  may temporarily sell or lease the water or delivery rights. Notwithstanding Section 
13340 of the Government Code, the proceeds of any water sales pursuant to this section by the Board  are 
appropriated directly to the  Board  without regard to fiscal year. The  Board  shall  use the proceeds of the 
sale,  lease or transfer of water or delivery rights to achieve conservation purposes authorized by this 

35 

section. The acquisition of water using funds expended  pursuant to this chapter shall  only be  used for 
projects that will provide fisheries, wildlife or ecosystem benefits. 

86121. The sum of fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) is  appropriated from the Fund to the California 
Department of Fish  and  Wildlife for the purpose of improving water supply and water qualityconditions 
for fish  and wildlife on private lands. The California  Department of Fish and Wildlife may provide 
incentives to landowners for conservation actions on private lands or use of voluntary habitat credit 
exchange mechanisms. Such incentives shall be designed to be  appropriately flexible and  responsive to 
the highly variable amounts of water required by fish and wildlife. 

The  Department of Fish and Wildlife shall  use  a portion of the funds provided by this section to develop a 
programmatic authorization to expedite approval of habitat restoration and water quality improvement 
projects not covered  under Chapter 6.5 of Division 2 of the Fish and  Game Code,  and for the 
implementation of that Chapter. 

86122. The sum  of three hundred million dollars ($300,000,000) is  appropriated from the Fund to the 
Wildlife Conservation Board for coastal and  Central Valley salmon and steelhead fisheries restoration 
projects. The  Wildlife Conservation  Board  shall give priority to projects that contribute to the recovery of 
salmon and steelhead species  listed pursuant to the state or federal endangered species acts, to enhance 
commercial and recreational salmon fisheries and to achieve the goals of Chapter 8 of Part 1 of Division 6 
(commencing with Section 6900) of the Fish  and  Game Code. 

(a) Of the amount appropriated by this section,  up to one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) shall  be 
spent for matching grants to local agencies for capital outlay projects to implement programs to improve 
fish  passage opportunities and  to restore anadromous salmonid habitats, particularly juvenile rearing 
habitat for spring run  salmon, on rivers in the Sacramento Valley that have  dams blocking the main stem 
of the river. 

(b) Of the amount appropriated by this section, at least one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) shall 

be  spent to install fish  screens on the Sacramento and  San Joaquin  Rivers and their tributaries and  in the 

Delta to screen anadromous fish from water intakes.  High priority shall go to projects identified as  high 

priority in the Sacramento Valley Salmon Resiliency Strategy (as published  by the California  Natural 

Resources Agency in June 2017, and as it may be amended). 


86123. (a) The sum  of two hundred eighty million dollars ($280,000,000) is  appropriated from the Fund to 
the Wildlife Conservation Board for projects to protect migratory birds through habitat acquisition, 
easements,  restoration, or other projects, and to provide water for wildlife refuges and  wildlife habitat 
areas to fulfill the purposes identified in the Central Valley Joint Venture Implementation Plan, as  it may 
be  amended, including: 

(1)  Projects to implement this section which may include conservation actions on private lands. 

(2)  Protection and  restoration of riparian and  wetland  habitat in the Sacramento River Basin. 

(3)  Protection and  restoration of riparian and  wetland  habitat in the San Joaquin and Tulare 

Basins. 

(b) Of the amount appropriated by this section, forty million dollars ($40,000,000) shall  be  deposited in 
the California Waterfowl Habitat Preservation Account established  pursuant to Section  3467 of the Fish 

36 

and Game Code, for the purposes of implementing the California Waterfowl Habitat Program pursuant to 
Article 7 (commencing with Section 3460) of Chapter 2 of Part 1 of Division 4 of the Fish  and Game Code, 
the California  Landowner Incentive Program of the Department of Fish  and Wildlife, the Permanent 
Wetland  Easement Program of the Wildlife Conservation  Board,  and the establishment or enhancement 
of waterfowl nesting and  other wildlife habitat cover on  fallowed  lands including projects authorized 
pursuant to Section  1018. 

(c)  Of the amount appropriated by this section, ten million dollars ($10,000,000) shall  be  deposited in the 
Shared  Habitat Alliance for Recreational Enhancement (SHARE)  Account established  pursuant to Section 
1572 of the Fish  and  Game Code and  administered by the Department of Fish  and Wildlife for the 
purposes of providing hunting and  other wildlife-dependent recreational opportunities to the public 
through voluntary agreements with private landowners. 

(d) Of the amount appropriated by this section, at least one hundred and ten million dollars 
($110,000,000) shall be expended for acquisition and delivery of water to wildlife refuges, and  associated 
infrastructure projects, to achieve full compliance with the terms of subsection (d) of Section 3406 of the 
Central Valley Project Improvement Act (Title 34 of Public Law 102-575). 

CHAPTER 8.6. Sacramento Region  Water Reliability and  Habitat Protection. 

86124. (a) Ten  million dollars ($10,000,000) is appropriated from the Fund to the department for grants 
to the Regional Water Authority and to the City of Sacramento on  behalf of the Sacramento Area Water 
Forum for projects that are consistent with the coequal  objectives of the Water Forum Agreement. 
Eligible projects include facilities, studies and other actions to improve flow and  temperature conditions 
and  habitat in the lower American River,  increase water use efficiency and  conservation, or improve the 
integration of surface water and groundwater supplies to provide for dry year water supply reliability. 

(b) The Regional Water Authority and the Water Forum  shall jointly develop and  approve studies, 
projects, or programs to be funded  by the grants.  Highest priority shall  be given to improving water 
temperature conditions in the lower American  River, and  to projects or programs that contribute to both 
of the Water Forum's coequal  objectives of improving water supply and  protecting the environment. The 
Regional Water Authority will be  the grantee for water supply and water efficiency projects. The City of 
Sacramento, on behalf of the Water Forum, will be the grantee for environmental protection, water 
temperature studies, and  habitat restoration projects. 

(c) The amount allocated in aggregate to the package of projects shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of 
the projects' total cost. 

(d)  No funds appropriated pursuant to this section may  be  spent to build new surface storage or raise 
existing reservoirs. 

CHAPTER 9.  Bay Area Regional Water Reliability. 

86125. Two hundred and fifty million dollars ($250,000,000) is  appropriated from the Fund  to the 
department for a grant to the group of eight water agencies collectively known as the Bay Area  Regional 
Reliability Partnership (BARR)  for new facilities that extend the benefits of surface water storage for 
region-wide benefits in  any of the following areas:  drought supply reliability, drinking water quality, and 
emergency storage, as generally described in the Final  Mitigation Project List contained in the San 
Francisco  Bay Area  Regional  Reliability Drought Contingency Plan. The Contra Costa  Water District may 

37 

receive the grant on behalf of the Partnership unless the BARR  Partnership has a governance structure in 
place at the time of the grant award that makes its eligible to receive the funds directly. The  participating 
water agencies in the San  Francisco Bay Area  Regional  Reliability Drought Contingency Plan will 
determine and  designate funds to one  or any of the listed projects,  however in  no case will the amount 
determined for any single project be  more than 50% of the project's total cost.  No funds appropriated 
pursuant to this section  may be spent to build  new surface storage, or raise  existing reservoirs. 

CHAPTER 10. Improved Water Conveyance and Water Conservation. 

86126.  Even  though the drought has eased, the effects of the drought are still being felt in many areas 
throughout the state, including the San Joaquin Valley.  Further exacerbating the impact of drought 
conditions on water users were legal requirements restricting pumping from the Sacramento-San Joaquin 
Delta. One of the consequences of both the drought and  pumping restrictions was a significant increase 
in groundwater pumping as a means to replace reduced surface supplies. Such  increase in groundwater 
pumping lowers groundwater tables, which in turn causes wells to go dry and  land to subside, which has 
particularly been  the case  on the east side of the San Joaquin Valley. The  Friant-Kern Canal  has lost 60% 
of its capacity to convey water for both consumptive uses and groundwater recharge.  Unless conveyance 
capacity is restored and  increased, the subsidence will continue to get worse and those local 
communities, including disadvantaged communities, who largely rely on groundwater to serve their 
citizens, will continue to suffer adverse effects. Significant public benefits will result from this state 
investment, including avoiding increased  unemployment, stabilization of groundwater, and securing a 
more stable food supply for California. 

86127. The sum of seven  hundred fifty million dollars ($750,000,000) is  appropriated from the Fund to 
the department for a grant to the Friant Water Authority for water conveyance capital improvements, 
including restored and  increased conveyance capacity to and  in the Madera and Friant-Kern canals, 
resulting in greater groundwater recharge, improved conveyance and  utilization of floodwaters, and  for 
water conservation. Improvements with funds provided  by this paragraph shall be  completed consistent 
with applicable state and federal laws and  contracts. 

86128. The sum of one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000) is appropriated from the Fund to the 
Natural Resources Agency for actions that support projects defined in  paragraph 11 in the settlement 
agreement to restore the San Joaquin  River referenced  in Section 2080.2 of the Fish  and  Game Code. 
Before expenditure may occur, formal concurrence on  specific projects to be  undertaken is  required  by 
the settling parties to the agreement. 

86129. The diversion of water from Barker Slough to the North Bay Aqueduct adversely impacts listed fish 
species, and  also adversely impacts water quality served to a large urban area. There would be  multiple 
public benefits to relocating the diversion to the North Bay Aqueduct to the Sacramento  River. 

86130. The  sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000} is appropriated from the fund to the department to 
plan for a diversion of water from the Sacramento River to the North Bay Aqueduct to reduce the adverse 
impact on listed fish species,  and  provide a higher quality of drinking water to those served  by the 
Aqueduct. 

CHAPTER 11. Oroville Dam Flood Safety. 

38 


86131. Oroville Dam  provides flood control for the Sacramento Valley. The  inclusion of flood control at 
Oroville Dam  was  not an  obligation of the public water agencies that receive water from Oroville Dam. 
The  flood control function of Oroville Dam was paid for by the federal government. 

86132. The  sum of two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000) is appropriated from the Fund to the 
department for repair and  reconstruction of the spillways at the Oroville Dam. 

86133. The sum  of twenty-one million dollars ($21,000,000) is appropriated from the Fund  to the 
department. Fifteen million dollars ($15,000,000) shall  be spent for Feather River sediment management 
and  removal  between Live Oak and  Verona in coordination with the Sutter Butte Flood Control Agency. 
Six million dollars ($6,000,000) of these funds shall be awarded as a grant to the Sutter Butte Flood 
Control Agency for floodwater attenuation projects at the Oroville Wildlife Area that provide downstream 
flood control  relief and ecosystem restoration. 

86134. The sum  of one million dollars ($1,000,000) is appropriated from the Fund to the department for a 
grant to Butte County for capital outlay projects and  equipment for emergency preparedness 
coordination and  communications consistent with the California Office of Emergency Services 
Standardized  Emergency Management System (SEMS). 

CHAPTER 12. General Provisions. 

86151. (a)  In  projects involving voluntary habitat restoration, water quality improvement and  multiÂ­
benefit floodplain restoration each agency administering provisions of this division shall  encourage 
interagency coordination and  develop and  utilize efficient project approval and  permitting mechanisms, 
including but not limited to the provisions of Chapter 6.5 of Division 2 of the Fish and  Game Code 
(regardless of whether that chapter is still in effect) and  programmatic permits for voluntary habitat 
restoration, so  as to avoid  project delays and  maximize the amount of money spent on project 
implementation. 

(b)  Projects designed to primarily protect migratory birds through acquisition, easements,  restoration or 
other projects shall be consistent with the plans and  recommendations established by the federal 
Migratory Bird Joint Venture partnerships that encompass parts of California. 

(c)  Any agency providing funds pursuant to this division to disadvantaged communities or economically 
distressed areas may provide funding to assist these communities in applying for that funding,  including 
technical and  grant writing assistance. These funds may be  provided to nonprofit organizations and  local 
public agencies assisting these communities. 

(d) Any agency receiving funds pursuant to this division may contract for the services ofresource 
conservation districts pursuant to Section 9003 of the Public Resources Code. 

(e) Agencies may count in-kind contributions up to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total project cost as 
part of cost sharing. Agencies may count the value of the donated land  in a bargain  sale as part of cost 
sharing. 

(f) Agencies considering proposals for acquisition of lands shall also consider the ability of the proposed 
final  owner of the land to maintain it in  a condition that will protect the values for which itis to be 
acquired, and to prevent any problems that might occur on neighboring lands if the  land is  not properly 
managed. 

39 

(g) Trust funds established  pursuant to this act shall be  managed pursuant to the requirements of the 
Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act,  Part 7 (commencing with Section 18501) of 
Division 9 of the Probate Code. 

(h)  Projects designed to primarily protect riparian  habitat through acquisition, easements, restoration or 
other projects shall consider the plans and  recommendations established by the California  Riparian 
Habitat Conservation Program pursuant to Chapter 4.1 of Division 2 of the Fish  and Game Code 
(commencing with Section 1385). 

(i) The administering agency shall  provide advance payment of 50% of grant awards for those projects 
that satisfy both of the following criteria: 

(1) The  project proponent is a disadvantaged community or eligible entity as defined in 

subdivision (a)  of Section 86166, or the project benefits a disadvantaged community. 

(2) The grant award for the project is less than one million dollars ($1,000,000). 

(j)  Eligible grant costs shall include indirect costs as  defined in federal Office of Management and  Budget 
guidelines, as well as  reasonable overhead costs. 

(k)  Agencies receiving funds designated for specific programs or grantees shall expedite the expenditure 
or transfer of those funds with the least amount of process necessary to comply with existing state laws 
and  regulations, and the requirements of this division. It is the intent of this division that the expenditure 
or transfer of funds shall  be efficient, cost-effective, and  expeditious, and generally should occur no later 
than 90 days from demonstrated eligibility by the recipient for the funds requested. 

86152. Agencies shall, to the extent practicable, quantify the amount of water generated for human and 
environmental use  resulting from proposed expenditures they make pursuant to this division. Agencies 
shall, to the extent practicable, quantify the improvement in the quality of water generated for human 
and environmental use  resulting from proposed expenditures they make pursuant to this division. 

86153. To the extent consistent with the other provisions of this division, statewide agencies making 
grants pursuant to this division shall seek to allocate funds equitably to eligible projects throughout the 
state, including northern and southern California, coastal and  inland  regions, and Sierra  and  Cascade 
foothill and  mountain regions. 

86154. Applicants for grants pursuant to this division shall  indicate whether the grant proposal is 
consistent with the local Integrated Regional Water Management Plan,  if one exists.  However, 
consistency with the Integrated Regional Water Management Plan  shall  not be  required as  a condition of 
any grant, and grant proposals shall not be given lower priority if they are  not consistent with Integrated 
Regional Water Management Plans. 

86155. (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, a local  public agency with a population of 
less than 100,000 and  a median household income of less than one hundred percent (100%) of the state 
average household income shall  be  required to provide matching funds of no  more than thirty-five 
percent (35%) for a grant for a project entirely within their jurisdiction. State agencies making grants to 
these local public agencies may provide funding in  advance  of construction of portions of the project, if 
the state agency determines that requiring the local public agency to wait for payment until the project is 
completed would  make the project infeasible. 

40 

(b)  Nothing in this section  prohibits a state agency from making a grant to a disadvantaged community or 
economically distressed area that does not require cost sharing. 

86156. Any repayment of loans made pursuant to this division, including interest payments, and interest 
earnings shall be  deposited in the  Fund  and shall be  available solely for the purposes of the chapter or 
section that authorized the loan. 

86157. (a)  Each  state agency that receives an  appropriation of funding made available by this division 
shall  be  responsible for establishing metrics of success and  reporting the status of projects and  all  uses of 
the funding on the state's bond accountability Internet Web site.

time and  within scope. 

86158. (a)  For projects carried out by state agencies pursuant to this division, up to ten percent (10%)  of 
funds allocated for each  program funded by this division may be  expended for planning,  monitoring and 
reporting necessary for the successful  design, selection, and  implementation of the projects and 
verification of benefits. An  eligible entity receiving a grant for a project pursuant to this division may also 
receive sufficient funds for planning, monitoring and  reporting necessary for the successful design, 
selection, and  implementation of the projects. This section shall not otherwise restrict funds ordinarily 
used  by an  agency for "preliminary plans," "working drawings," and  "construction" for a capital outlay 
project or grant project. 

(b)  Permit and  plan  check fees  and  reasonable administrative and  indirect project fees and costs related 
to managing construction shall be  deemed part of construction costs.  Project costs allocated for project 
planning and  design, and  direct and  indirect administrative costs shall  be  identified as separate line items 
in the project budget. 

86159. Notwithstanding Section 16727 of the Government Code, funding provided pursuant to Chapters 6 
and  8 may be  used for grants and  loans to nonprofit organizations to repay financing described in Section 
22064 of the Financial Code  related to projects that are consistent with the  purposes of those chapters. 

86160. Not more than a total offive percent (5%)  of the funds allocated to any state agency under this 
division may be used to pay for its costs of administering programs and  projects specified in this division. 

86161. (a)  Water quality monitoring data shall be collected and  reported to the State board in  a manner 
that is  compatible and  consistent with surface water monitoring data systems or groundwater monitoring 
data systems administered by the State board, consistent with Part 4.9  of Division 6.  Watershed 
monitoring data shall be collected and  reported to the Department of Conservation in  a manner that is 
compatible and  consistent with the statewide watershed program administered by the Department of 
Conservation. 

41 

(bl State agencies making grants or loans pursuant to this division may include specific expenditures for 
compliance with local, state and federal permitting and other requirements. 

(c)  Up to one percent (1%l of funds allocated for each program funded  by this division may be expended 
for research  into methods to improve water supply, water related habitat, and  water quality relevant to 
that program,  in addition to any other amounts provided for in this division. 

86162. (al Prior to disbursing grants or loans pursuant to this division, each  state agency that receives an 
appropriation from the funding made available by this division to administer a grant or loan program 
under this division shall  develop and adopt project solicitation and evaluation guidelines. The guidelines 
shall include monitoring and  reporting requirements and  may include a limitation on  the dollar amount of 
each grantor loan to be awarded. The guidelines shall  not include a prohibition on the recovery of 
reasonable overhead or indirect costs by local public agencies, Indian tribes or nonprofit organizations. 
If the state agency has previously developed and  adopted project solicitation and evaluation guidelines 
that comply with the requirements of this division, it may use those guidelines. Overhead or indirect costs 
incurred by a local public agency, Indian tribe or nonprofit organization are eligible for reimbursement 
and  shall not weigh  negatively in the evaluation of funding proposals pursuant to this division. 

(bl  Prior to disbursing grants or loans, the state agency shall conduct three regional public meetings to 
consider public comments prior to finalizing the guidelines. The state agency shall publish the draft 
solicitation and evaluation guidelines on its website at least 30 days  before the public meetings. One 
meeting shall  be conducted at a location in  northern California, one meeting shall  be conducted at a 
location in the Central Valley of California, and  one meeting shall  be conducted at a location in  southern 
California. Agencies without jurisdiction in  one or more of these three regions may omit the meetings in 
the region or regions within which they do not have jurisdiction. Upon adoption, the state agency shall 
transmit copies of the guidelines to the fiscal committees and the appropriate policy committees of the 
Legislature. 

(c)  At least 45 days prior to soliciting projects pursuant to this division, a state agency administering funds 
pursuant to this division shall  post an  electronic form of the guidelines for grant applicants on  its website. 
Project solicitation and  evaluation guidelines shall only include criteria  based on the applicable 
requirements of this division. 

(d)  Nothing in this division restricts agencies from enforcing and  complying with existing laws. 

86163. Each  project funded from this division shall comply with the following requirements: 

(al The  investment of public funds pursuant to this division will result in  public benefits that address the 
most critical statewide needs and  priorities for public funding, as  determined by the agency distributing 
the funds. 

(bl In the appropriation and  expenditure of funding authorized  by this division, priority will be  given to 
projects that leverage private, federal, or local funding or produce the greatest public benefit. All state 
agencies receiving funds pursuant to this division shall seek to leverage the funds to the greatest extent 
possible,  but agencies shall take into account the limited ability to cost share by small public agencies, 
and  by agencies seeking to benefit disadvantaged communities and  economically distressed areas. 

(c)  A funded project shall  advance the purposes of the chapter from which the project received funding. 

42 

(d)  In  making decisions regarding water resources pursuant to this division, state and  local agencies will 
use the best available science to inform those decisions. 

(e) To  the extent practicable, a project supported by funds  made available by this division will include 
signage  informing the public that the project received funds from the Water Supply and  Water Quality Act 
of 2018. 

(f) To the extent feasible, projects funded with proceeds from this division shall promote state planning 
priorities consistent with the provisions of Section 65041.1 of the Government Code and sustainable 
communities strategies consistent with the provisions of subparagraph  (B)  of paragraph  (2)  of subdivision 
(b) of Section 65080 of the Government Code. 

(g) To the extent feasible, watershed objectives for private lands included in this division should be 
achieved through use of conservation easements and voluntary landowner participation, including, but 
not limited to, the use of perpetual conservation easements pursuant to Division 10.2 (commencing with 
Section 10200) and  Division 10.4 (commencing with Section  10330) of the Public Resources Code, 
voluntary habitat credit exchange mechanisms, and  conservation actions on private lands. 

86164. Funds  provided  by this division shall  not be  expended to pay the costs of the design, construction, 
operation, mitigation, or maintenance of Delta water conveyance facilities. Those costs shall be the 
responsibility of the water agencies that benefit from the design, construction, operation, mitigation, or 
maintenance of those facilities. 

86165. (a) This division does not diminish, impair, or otherwise affect in  any manner whatsoever any area 
of origin, watershed of origin, county of origin, or any other water rights protections, including, but not 
limited to, rights to water appropriated  prior to December 19, 1914, provided  under the law. This division 
does not limit or affect the application of Article 1.7 (commencing with Section 1215) of Chapter 1 of Part 
2 of Division 2, Sections 10505, 10505.5, 11128, 11460, 11461, 11462, and 11463, and Sections 12200 to 
12220, inclusive. 

(b)  For the purposes of this division, an area that utilizes water that has been diverted and conveyed from 
the Sacramento River hydrologic region, for use outside the Sacramento River hydrologic region or the 
Delta, shall  not be deemed to be immediately adjacent thereto or capable of being conveniently supplied 
with water therefrom by virtue or on  account of the diversion and  conveyance of that water through 
facilities that may be constructed for that purpose after January 1,2018. 

(c)  Nothing in this division supersedes,  limits, or otherwise modifies the applicability of Chapter 10 
(commencing with Section 1700) of Part 2 of Division 2,  including petitions related to any new 
conveyance constructed or operated  in accordance with Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 85320)of 
Part 4 of Division 35. 

(d)  Unless otherwise expressly provided, nothing in this division supersedes,  reduces, or otherwise affects 
existing legal protections, both procedural and substantive, relating to the State board's regulation of 
diversion and  use of water, including, but not limited to, water right priorities, the protection provided to 
municipal interests by Sections 106 and  106.5, and changes in  water rights.  Nothing in this division 
expands or otherwise alters the State  board's existing authority to regulate the diversion and  use of water 
or the courts' existing concurrent jurisdiction over California water rights. 

(e)  Nothing in this division shall  be construed to affect the California Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (Chapter 

43 

1.4 (commencing with Section 5093.50) of Division 5 of the Public Resources Code) or the federal Wild 
and Scenic Rivers Act (16  U.S.C. Section 1271 et seq.) and funds authorized pursuant to this division shall 
not be  available for any project that could  have an adverse effect on the values upon which a wild and 
scenic river or any other river is  afforded protections pursuant to the California Wild  and  Scenic Rivers Act 
or the federal Wild and  Scenic  Rivers Act. 

(f) Nothing in this division supersedes, limits, or otherwise modifies the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta 
Reform Act of 2009 (Division 35 (commencing with Section 85000)) or any other applicable law, including, 
but not limited to,  Division 22.3 (commencing with Section 32300) of the Public Resources Code. 

(g)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any agency or nonprofit organization acquiring land 
pursuant to this division may make use of the Natural Heritage Preservation Tax Credit Act of 2000 
(Division 28 (commencing with Section 37000) of the Public Resources Code).  Funds appropriate pursuant 
to this division that are not designated for competitive grant programs may also  be used for the purposes 
of reimbursing the General  Fund  pursuant to the Natural Heritage Preservation Tax  Credit Act of 2000. 

(h)  Funds provided  pursuant to this division, and  any appropriation or transfer of those funds, shall not be 
deemed to be a transfer of funds for the purposes of Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 2780) of 
Division 3 of the Fish  and  Game Code.

(5)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, agencies receiving funds pursuant to this 

division may reduce or eliminate cost sharing requirements when making grants of one million dollars 
($1,000,000) or less to nonprofit organizations with budgets less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) if 

44 

the agency determines that such grants would be the most effective way to achieve the purposes of this 
division.

Reliability and  Drought Protection Fund  of 2018, which is hereby created in the State Treasury. 

86169.1 Notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code,  moneys in the Water Supply Reliability 
and  Drought Protection Fund of 2018 are continuously appropriated without regard to fiscal year for the 
purposes of this division in the manner set forth in this division. Funds authorized by,  and  made available 
pursuant to this division shall be available and expended only as provided in  this division, and shall  not be 
subject to appropriation or transfer by the Legislature or the Governor for any other purpose. 

86170. Chapter 3.5  (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 ofTitle 2 of the Government

relatively high cost-effectiveness, durability, and  enhanced environmentalquality. 

45 

86174. Acquisitions pursuant to Chapter 6 of this division shall be from willing sellers only. 

86177. The requirement that a project be cost-effective does not require a full  benefit/cost analysis. 

86178. Agencies implementing this division shall give special consideration to projects that employ new 
or innovative technology or practices, including decision support tools that support the integration of 
multiple strategies and jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, water supply, wildfire reduction,

the effective date of this act, overhead or indirect costs incurred by a local public agency,  Indian tribe or 
nonprofit organization are eligible for reimbursement and shall not weigh negatively in the evaluation of 
funding proposals. Eligible grant costs shall include indirect costs as defined in federal Office of 
Management and  Budget guidelines, as well as  reasonable overhead costs.  For nonprofit organizations,

out the purposes expressed  in this division and to reimburse the General Obligation Bond  Expense 
Revolving Fund  pursuant to Section  16724.5 of the Government Code. The  bonds, when sold, shall  be  and 
constitute a valid  and  binding obligation of the State of California, and the full faith and  credit of the State 
of California  is hereby pledged  for the punctual payment of both principal of, and  interest on, the bonds 
as the principal and  interest become due and  payable. 

45 

(b) The Treasurer shall from time to time sell the bonds authorized by the committee pursuant to Section 
86182.  Bonds shall be sold  upon the terms and  conditions specified in one or more resolutions to be 
adopted by the committee pursuant to Section 16731 of the Government Code. 

86181. The  bonds authorized by this division shall  be  prepared, executed, issued, sold,  paid, and 
redeemed as  provided in the State General Obligation Bond  Law,  and all of the provisions of that law, as 
that law may be  amended, apply to the bonds and to this division and  are hereby incorporated in this 
division as though set forth in full in this division, except subdivisions (a)  and  (b) of Section 16727 of the 
Government Code. 

86182. (a) Solely for the purpose of authorizing the issuance and  sale  pursuant to the State General 
Obligation Bond  Law of the bonds authorized by this division, the Water Supply Reliability and  Drought 
Protection Finance Committee is hereby created.  For purposes of this division, the Water Supply 
Reliability and  Drought Protection  Finance Committee is the "committee" as that term is  used  in the State 
General Obligation Bond Law. 

(b) The finance committee consists of the Director of Finance, the Treasurer, and the Controller.

of bonds to be issued and  sold. Successive issues of bonds may be authorized and sold to carry out those 
actions progressively, and  it is  not necessary that all of the bonds authorized to be issued  be sold at any 
one time.

revenue is collected,  in addition to the ordinary revenues of the state, a sum  in an  amount required to 
pay the principal of, and  interest on, the bonds each year. It is the duty of all officers charged  by law with 
any duty in  regard to the collection of the revenue to do and  perform each  and  every act that is necessary 
to collect that additional sum. 

86186. Notwithstanding Section 13340 of the Government Code, there is  hereby appropriated from the 
General Fund  in the State Treasury,  for the purposes of this division, an amount that will equal the total

Money Investment Account in  accordance with Section  16312 of the Government Code  for the purpose of 
carrying out this division less any amount withdrawn pursuant to Section 86189. The amount of the 
request shall not exceed the amount of the unsold bonds that the committee has,  by resolution, 
authorized to be  sold  (excluding any refunding bond authorized pursuant to Section 86192) for the 
purpose of carrying out this division. The  board shall execute those documents required  by the Pooled 
Money Investment Board to obtain and  repay the loan. Any amounts loaned shall be  deposited in the 
Fund to be allocated  in accordance with this division. 

86188. Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, or of the State General Obligation Bond Law, 
if the Treasurer sells bonds that include a bond counsel opinion to the effect that the interest on the 
bonds is excluded from gross income for federal tax purposes under designated conditions or is otherwise 
entitled to any federal tax advantage, the Treasurer may maintain separate accounts for the bond 
proceeds invested and for the investment earnings on those proceeds, and  may use  or direct the use of 
those proceeds or earnings to pay any rebate, penalty, or other payment required under federal law or 
take any other action with respect to the investment and  use of those  bond  proceeds, as may be  required 
or desirable under federal law in order to maintain the tax-exempt status of those bonds and  to obtain 
any other advantage under federal law on behalf of the funds of this state. 

86189. For the purposes of carrying out this division, the Director of Finance may authorize the 
withdrawal from the General  Fund  of an  amount or amounts not to exceed the amount of the unsold 
bonds that have been  authorized by the committee to be  sold (excluding any refunding bond authorized 
pursuant to Section 86192) for the purpose of carrying out this division less any amount borrowed 
pursuant to Section 86187. Any amounts withdrawn shall  be deposited in the Fund. Any moneys made 
available under this section shall be  returned to the General Fund, with interest at the rate earned by the 
moneys in the Pooled Money Investment Account, from proceeds received from the sale  of bonds for the 
purpose of carrying out this division. 

86190. All  moneys deposited in the Fund that are derived from  premium and  accrued  interest on bonds 
sold  pursuant to this division shall  be  reserved  in the Fund  and shall be  available for transfer to the 
General Fund  as a credit to expenditures for bond  interest, except that amounts derived from premium 
may be reserved and  used to pay the cost of bond issuance prior to any transfer to the General Fund. 

86191. Pursuant to the State General Obligation Bond Law, the cost of bond  issuance shall be  paid  out of 
the bond  proceeds,  including premiums, if any. To  the extent the cost of bond issuance is not paid from 
premiums received from the sale of bonds, these costs shall  be  shared proportionately by each  program 
funded through this division by the applicable bond sale. 

86192. The  bonds issued  and  sold pursuant to this division may be  refunded  in  accordance with Article 6 
(commencing with Section  16780) of Chapter 4 of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code, 
which is  a part of the State General Obligation Bond  Law.  Approval by the voters of the state for the 
issuance of the bonds under this division shall include approval of the issuance of any  bonds issued  to 
refund any bonds originally issued  under this division or any previously issued  refunding bonds. Any bond 
refunded  with the proceeds of refunding bonds as authorized  by this section  may be  legally defeased to 
the extent permitted by law in  the manner and to the extent set forth in the resolution,  as amended from 
time to time, authorizing such  refunded bonds. 

86193. The  proceeds from the sale of bonds authorized by this division are  not "proceeds of taxes" as 
that term  is used  in  Article XIII  B of the California Constitution, and the disbursement of these proceeds is 

48 

not subject to the limitations imposed by that article. 

SECTION 2. Section 1 of this act shall take effect immediately upon approval by the voters of the Water 
Supply and Water Quality Act of 2018, as set forth in that section at the November 6,  2018, statewide 
general election. In  order to fund a water supply reliability and  drought protection program  at the 
earliest  possible  date,  it  is  necessary  that this  act  take  effect  immediately. 

SECTION 3.  Conflicting Provisions. 

(a) The provisions and intent of the Water Supply and Water Quality Act of 2018 shall  be given 
precedence over any state law, statute, regulation or policy that conflicts with this section, and the policy 
and  intent of this act shall prevail over any such contrary law, statute, regulation or policy. 

(b)  If this division is approved by the voters, but superseded by any other conflicting ballot division
