CHARITABLE HOSPITAL EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION ACT OF 2016 

This initiative measure is submitted to the people in accordance with the provisions of 

Article II, Section 8 of the California Constitution. 

This initiative measure amends and adds sections to the Corporations Code and 

Government Code; therefore, existing provisions proposed to be deleted are printed in strikeout 
type and new provisions proposed to be added are printed in italic type to indicate that they are 
new. 

SECTION 1.  Name. 

This Act shall be known as the "Charitable Hospital Executive Compensation Act 

of2016." 

SEC. 2.  Findings and Purposes. 

This Act, adopted by the people of the State of California, makes the following Findings 

and has the following Purpose. 

A.  The People make the following findings: 

( 1)  The compensation packages of chief executive officers, executives, managers, and 
administrators of hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities, that operate under 
nonprofit corporate status are often excessive, unnecessary, and inconsistent with the 
corporations' charitable purposes, as revealed by compensation surveys and other sources. 

(2)  Payment of excessive compensation to executives, managers, and administrators undermines 
the purposes of nonprofit corporations because it results in fewer funds being available for their 
charitable purposes, and it is often the case that the hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated 
medical entities that pay the most excessive compensation also provide less charitable care than 
comparable institutions that pay reasonable compensation to their executives, managers, and 
administrators. 

(3)  Existing requirements of law do not adequately ensure that assets held for charitable 
purposes are not instead used to enrich executives, managers, and administrators of nonprofit 
hospitals, hospital groups, and affiliated medical entities through payment of excessive 
compensation. 

( 4)  Executives, managers, and administrators of nonprofit hospitals, hospital groups, and 
affiliated medical entities can be reasonably compensated without receiving more than the 
President of the United States of America, who earns $450,000 per year. 

1 

B.  Purposes: 

( 1)  It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that compensation packages for chief executive 
officers, executives, managers, and administrators of nonprofit hospitals, hospital groups, and 
affiliated medical entities are consistent with the charitable purposes of such nonprofits and are 
reasonable and not excessive in light of the substantial public benefit that the State tax exemption 
for nonprofit organizations conveys. 

(2)  This Act would achieve this purpose by limiting such chief executive officers, executives, 
managers, and administrators to compensation packages no more exorbitant than the 
compensation received by the President of the United States of America, which is $450,000 per 
year. 

(3)  This Act is intended to be budget neutral for the State to implement and administer. 

SEC. 3. 

Section 12586.3 is added to Article 7 of Chapter 6 of Part 2 of Division 3 of the Government 
Code, to read: 

12586.3(a)  The board of directors of a nonprofit corporation that owns,  operates,  or controls,  in

duties at or for a covered hospital or medical entity are executive,  managerial, or administrative 
receives total annual compensation from any source for work performed or services provided at 
or for the covered hospital or medical entity that is greater than the annual salary and expense 
allowance of the President of the United States as set forth in Section 102 ofTitle 3 of the United

disability insurance or payments or contributions to a health reimbursement account.  Nor shall 
"total annual compensation" include the cost of any benefit or remuneration to the extent the

state or federal constitution.

(1)  The total value of a severance or similar post-employment or post-service 

compensation arrangement or severance payments shall include the fair market value of all cash

and (3) to represent as  legal counsel any other agency or department of the State of California 
expressly empowered to act with respect to the status of religious corporations, or expressly 
empowered to regulate activities in which religious corporations, as well as other entities, may 
engage. 

(d)  Where property has been solicited and received from the general public, based on a 
representation that it would be used for a specific charitable purpose other than general support 
of the corporation's activities, and has been used in a manner contrary to that specific charitable 
purpose for which the property was solicited, the Attorney General may institute an action to 
enforce the specific charitable purpose for which the property was solicited; provided (1) that 
before bringing such action the Attorney General shall notify the corporation that an action will 
be brought unless the corporation takes immediate steps to correct the improper diversion of 
funds, and (2) that in the event it becomes impractical or impossible for the corporation to devote 
the property to the specified charitable purpose, or that the directors or members of the 
corporation in good faith expressly conclude and record in writing that the stated purpose for 
which the property was contributed is no longer in accord with the policies of the corporation, 
then the directors or members of the corporation may approve or ratify in good faith the use of 
such property for the general purposes of the corporation rather than for the specific purpose for 
which it was contributed. 

As used in this section, "solicited from the general public" means solicitations directed to the 
general public, or to any individual or group of individuals who are not directly affiliated with 
the soliciting organization and includes, but is not limited to, instances where property has been 
solicited on an individual basis such as door to door, direct mail, face to face,  or similar 
solicitations, as well as solicitations on a more general level to the general public, or a portion 

11 

thereof, such as through the media, including newspapers, television, radio, or similar 
solicitations. 

(e)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any individual rights of action which were 
accorded under law in existence prior to the enactment of Chapter 1324 of the Statutes of 1980. 

As used in this section, "individual rights of action" include only rights enforceable by private 
individuals and do not include any right of action of a public officer in an official capacity

California Legislature of any otherwise unlawful and duly authorized action by any agency of 
local government.
