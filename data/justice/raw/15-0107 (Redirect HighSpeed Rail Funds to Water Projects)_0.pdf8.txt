INITIATIVE MEASURE TO  BE SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO THE VOTERS 

SECTION 1.  WATER PRIORITIES PUBLIC INTEREST AND PUBLIC TRUST 
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 

Part 1.0 

Findings and Declarations 

The people of the State of California find and declare all of the following: 

(a) Safeguarding supplies of clean, safe drinking water to California's homes and 
businesses and water for irrigation to California's farms is an essential responsibility of 
government, and critical to protecting the quality oflife for Californians. 

(b) Every Californian should have access to clean, safe, and reliable drinking water 

and California farms to irrigation water, consistent with Article X of the California 
Constitution. Providing adequate supplies of clean, safe, and reliable water is vital to 
keeping California's economy growing and strong and meetthe needs of the State's 
population. 

(c) The California Constitution and the California Water Code, court decisions and 

administrative agency interpretations of beneficial use, public use and the public trust have 
imposed substantial legal and administrative impediments to the accomplishment of the 
people's priorities with respect to water use. 

( d) These legal and administrative impediments have thwarted the development of 

new surface water and groundwater storage facilities mandated by the voters and have 
wrapped those projects in endless court challenges and administrative red tape. 

(e) The State Legislature  has failed to exercise its legislative powers over the state's 

water resources granted under Article X,  California Constitution and as a result various 
agencies, boards, and commissions have asserted power and authority to regulate and 
enforce the laws of the state in the Legislature's name, or the uncertainty about the 
exercise of such powers has required adjudication and remediation actions by and in the 
courts, with outcomes and precedents that may not have correctly interpreted or reflected 
the Legislature's intentions about the use of the state's water resources. 

(f) This division is intended to promote the coequal goals, as defined in Section 

85054 of the Water Code, of providing a more reliable water supply for California through 
advancing the primary water criteria set forth in Article X,  section 2 of the California Article 
X,  California Constitution, is amended by adding the following subsection 2.5, as follows: 

AG  15-0107  12/14/15  V.  2 

1 

Part2.0 
new Section 2.5, as follows: 

Article X of the California Constitution is hereby amended by adding 

2.5.  Reasonable and Beneficial Public Uses of Water -- Priorities 

Because of the conditions prevailing in this State, and in furtherance of the provisions 
of section 2 hereof, including those provisions regarding beneficial uses, rights and 
appropriations of water resources, the public interest in assuring the highest priorities of 
beneficial use and water conservation, as a public benefit and to satisfy the public trust, 
shall be first, domestic use, and second, irrigation use through the development and 
maintenance of surface water and groundwater storage facilities. Establishment and 
designation of priorities for the reasonable and beneficial uses of water, as a public 
benefit 

in satisfaction of the public trust, are reserved to the People. 

SECTION 2.  THE NEW SURFACE WATER AND GROUNDWATER STORAGE FACILITIES 
BOND ACT OF 2016 

Part 1.0 

Findings and Declarations 

The people of the State of California find and declare all of the following: 

(a)  This measure implements measure implements in part the will and direction of 

the People as established in Article X, section 2.5 of the California Constitution, by 
providing California additional water supplies for domestic and irrigation use by its People. 

(b)  California faces a water-supply crisis spurred by inadequate anticipation of 

state water needs and our periodic drought, while the high-speed rail project adopted by 
voters in 2008 faces growing and dismaying reports that the project's costs will mushroom, 
its prospects for completion of the entire route, from San Francisco to Los Angeles with 
Sacramento and San Diego legs, are dismal, and potential federal and private funding 
sources have vanished.  $ 8 billion dollars of uncontracted high speed rail bonds sit 
uncommitted and unusable. Even if issued, the total funding provided by Proposition 
lA would be a drop in the bucket to funding the real eventual costs of a high-speed rail 
system equal to that promised to voters, already estimated at from $68 to $100 billion.  The 
high-speed rail bonds should be reallocated and redirected, as permitted by Article XVI, 
section 1 of the California Constitution, to address California's immediate and higher 
priority water supply needs. 

(c)  On November 4, 2008, the voters approved Proposition lA, the "Safe, Reliable 

High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act," which authorized the State of California to issue up 
to $9.95 billion in bonds to construct a high-speed train system and established the 
framework and requirements that the system would be required to achieve. 

AG  15-0107  12/14/15  V.  2 

2 

(d) On November 4, 2014, the voters approved Proposition 1, the "Water Quality, 

Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014," which authorized the state of 
California to issue up to $7.1 billion in bonds and redirected $425 million in unsold general 
obligation bonds that were previously approved by voters for resource-related uses to fund 
various water-related programs, including $2.7 billion in bonds for public benefits 
associated with water storage projects that improve the operation of the state water 
system, are cost effective, and provide a net improvement in ecosystem and water quality 
conditions. 

(e) This bond measure does not authorize additional net state bond obligations.  It 
redirects existing bond funding authority from Proposition 1A (2008) and Proposition 1 
(2014), for the purposes and the reasons described more fully herein. 

(f)  Every Californian should have access to clean, safe, and reliable drinking water 

and California farms to irrigation water, consistent with Article X of the California 
Constitution, section 2.5. Providing adequate supplies of clean, safe, and reliable water is 
vital to keeping California's economy growing and strong and meets the needs of the State's 
population. 

(g) Periodic drought has impaired California's capacity to of ensure sufficient 
supplies and reserves of clean, safe, and reliable water, droughts have become more 
frequent and more severe, and ecosystems have become stressed. Higher temperatures 
mean less snow pack, which is the state's largest water reservoir. State water agencies 
project a loss of at least 25 percent of the snow pack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains by 
2050. The Colorado River basin, which provides drinking water to southern California, has 
experienced prolonged drought. 

(h) California's water infrastructure continues to age and deteriorate. More than 50 
years ago, Californians approved the construction of the State Water Project. In the decades 
that followed, California's water leaders developed the most sophisticated system of state, 
federal, regional, and local water infrastructure anywhere in the world. Failure to complete 
the State Water Project as originally designed has resulted in it being unable to adequately 
serve its intended purpose. 

(i)  In the years since the voters approved the State Water Project and the Federal 
Central Valley Project was approved, California's population has continued to grow, from 
less than 16 million in 1960 to more than 39 million in 2015. A growing population and a 
growing economy have put greater stress on California's natural resources, including 
water. The Department of Finance projects that California's population will reach 50 
million by 2049. 

AG  15-0107  12/14/15  V.  2 

3 

U) A growing population and a growing economy have put greater stress on 

California's natural resources, including water quality, as documented by the U.S. 
Geological Survey, the California Department of Water Resources, and the University of 
California. 

(k) ~s California has grown and its water infrastructure has failed to keep up with 
that growth, increasing demands on California's limited water supplies, continuing needs 
for flood and earthquake disaster protection, and deteriorating aquatic ecosystems have 
led to intense conflict, further threatening the reliability of clean and safe drinking water. 

(l) Since the passage of Proposition lA, the voters have learned that the high-speed 

train system will not be able to meet any of the requirements of that measure. 

(1) Estimated construction costs for the project have more than doubled; 

(2) Promised travel times will be significantly longer; 

(3)  Travel speeds will be significantly slower than the "high speed" 200 miles-an(cid:173)

hour speeds; 

(4) Train routes will have intrusive impacts on communities and the environment; 

(5) Despite recent reports that the High-Speed Rail Authority has solicited potential 

private and foreign government investment interest, the Authority acknowledges that no 
such potential investors are likely to participate in funding of the project, and the project 
will not be financially viable without significant ongoing public subsidies in the tens of 
billions of dollars; and, 

(6) Technology advances have made obsolete the design concept approved by 

voters. 

(m) All remaining authorized and appropriated but unissued bonds from the Safe, 

Reliable High-Speed Passenger Train Bond Act should be redirected to provide that no 
further bonds shall be sold for high-speed rail and related rail purposes and instead that 
they shall be sold only for specified purposes authorized under this measure. 

(n) All uncommitted net proceeds received by the High Speed Rail Authority from 

outstanding bonds issued and sold prior to the effective date of the initiative should also be 
redirected from high-speed rail purposes to specified purposes authorized under this 
measure. 

( o) Since the passage of Proposition 1, the public has learned that restrictions in 

Proposition 1 limit uses of its funding to water storage projects that provide at least half of 

AG  15-0107  12/14/15  V.  2 

4 

their public benefits for purposes unrelated to the beneficial uses and conservation of 
water for domestic use and irrigation use as established in Article X,  section 2.5 of 
California Constitution, and find that they are an unacceptable limitation on the priority of 
use of funds appropriated for public benefits associated with water storage projects. 

(p) A specified portion of authorized but unissued bonds from the Water Quality, 

Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014 should be redirected to provide that 
no bonds shall be sold for the public benefits associated with water storage projects that 
improve the operation of the state water system as provided in that Act under Water Code 
Section 79750 and direct instead that they shall be sold only for specified purposes 
authorized under this measure. 

( q) The California Water Commission, an appointed and unelected body charged 

with responsibilities for overseeing and approving expenditures of funds from Proposition 
1 under Water Code Section 79750, is insufficiently representative of the population of the 
State as a whole, the various geographic regions of the State, and of the will of the people 
with respect to assessing public benefits for purposes related to the beneficial uses and 
conservation of water, including water for domestic use and irrigation use, and, as such is 
an inappropriate authority to fairly oversee the selection and implementation of projects 
providing public benefits associated with water storage projects that improve the 
operation of the state water system as established in Article X,  section 2.5 of the California 
Constitution. 

Part 3.0  Reallocation Of Previously Authorized Bond Authority And Funds

Groundwater Storage Facilities" to read: 

Chapter 1. General 

79800. This part shall be known and may be cited as the State New Surface Water and 
Groundwater Storage Facilities Bond Act of 2016. 

Article 1. 

79801  Findings: 

The People of California find and declare all of the following,in addition to the findings set 
forth in Sectionl , Part 1.0 of this Measure: 

(a) This bond measure implements in part the will and direction of the People as 
established in Article X, section 2.5 of the California Constitution, by providing California 
additional water supplies for domestic and irrigation use by its People. 

(b) California needs water quality improvements at all parts of the hydrologic cycle, 
from source water in the watersheds where the state's drinking water supplies originate to 
groundwater facilities. 

( c) Addressing the challenges to the heart of the California water system, will help 

resolve some of the conflicts that impede progress in improving the statewide water 
system. 

( d) Key to achieving these goals is the critical necessity to construct new state 
surface water storage and groundwater storage facilities and to improve and enhance 
existing state water storage facilities and groundwater storage facilities. 

( e) Development of the new water storage and groundwater storage facilities, and 
improvement of the existing water storage facilities provided for in this measure will not 
diminish, impair, or otherwise affect matters of public benefit or for the public trust, 
including but not limited to, any area of origin, watershed of origin, county of origin, or 
other water rights protections, including, but not limited to, rights to water appropriated 
prior to December 19, 1914, provided under existing law. 

AG  15-0107  12/14/15  V.  2 

6 

(f) This measure clarifies the locus of authority in the Authority created by this 

measure to make such determinations that the water projects provided for herein do not 
diminish, impair, or otherwise affect matters of public benefit or for the public trust, 
including but not limited to, any area of origin, watershed of origin, county of origin, or 
other water rights protections. 

79802. 
It is the intent of the People that: 

(a) The investment of public funds pursuant to this division will result in public 

benefits to the public trust that address the most critical statewide needs and priorities for 
public funding in preference to other needs and priorities that may exist. 

(b) In the appropriation and expenditure of funding authorized by this division, 

priority will be given to new surface water and groundwater storage facilities projects that 
provide for use of private, federal, or local funding and produce the greatest public benefit, 
as established in Article X, section 2.5 of the California Constitution. 

(c) A funded project advances the purposes of the chapter from which the project 

received funding. 

( d) In making decisions regarding water resources, the Executive Branch, the 
Legislature, and state and local water agencies must use recent research based upon 
confirmed, reproducible and transparent scientific principles and currently available 
technologies to inform those decisions. 

( e) The State Legislature has allowed state agencies to exercise its powers under 

Article X,  California Constitution to make determinations that water projects do not 
diminish, impair, or otherwise affect matters of public benefit or for the public trust, 
including but not limited to, any area of origin, watershed of origin, county of origin, or 
other water rights protections; and as to this measure, and the projects authorized 
hereunder, the Legislature, by a vote of its members, should be authorized to accept or 
reject the Authority's determinations concerning such matters, in supervention of any 
determinations by a state agency.

79820. 

(a) In approving the 2016 State Water Storage and Groundwater Storage Facilities 
Act, the people were informed and hereby declare that the provisions of this chapter are 
necessary, integral, and essential to meeting the single object or work of the Water Quality, 
Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014 and of this measure. As such, any 
amendment of the provisions of this chapter by the Legislature without voter approval 
would frustrate the scheme and design that induced voter approval of this measure. The 
people therefore find and declare that any amendment of the provisions of this chapter by 

AG  15-0107  12/14/15  V.  2 

21 

the Legislature shall require an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the membership in each 
house of the Legislature and voter approval. 

(b) This section shall not govern or be used as authority for determining whether 

the amendment of any other provision of this act not contained in this chapter would 
constitute a substantial change in the scheme and design of this act requiring voter 
approval.

(a) The bonds authorized by this chapter shall be prepared, executed, issued, sold, 

paid, and redeemed as provided in the State General Obligation Bond Law (Chapter 4

(a) Upon request of the State Allocation Board, the State New Surface Water and 
Groundwater Storage Facilities Finance Committee shall determine whether or not it is 
necessary or desirable to issue bonds authorized pursuant to this chapter in order to fund 
the related apportionments and, if so, the amount of bonds to be issued and sold. 
Successive issues of bonds may be authorized and sold to fund those apportionments 
progressively, and it is not necessary that all of the bonds authorized to be issued be sold at 
any one time. · 

(b) A request of the State Allocation Board pursuant to subdivision (a) shall be 

supported by a statement of the apportionments made and to be made for the purposes 
described in Sections 79814 and 79823. There shall be collected each year and in the same 
manner and at the same time as other state revenue is collected, in addition to the ordinary 
revenues of the state, a sum in an amount required to pay the principal of, and interest on, 
the bonds each year. It is the duty of all officers charged by law with any duty in regard to 
the collection of the revenue to do and perform each and every act that is necessary to 
collect that additional sum.

loan from the Pooled Money Investment Account or any other approved form of interim 
financing, in accordance with Section 16312 of the Government Code, for the purpose of 
carrying out this chapter. The amount of the request shall not exceed the amount of the 
unsold bonds ( exclusive of refunding bonds) that the committee, by resolution, has 
authorized to be sold for the purpose of carrying out this chapter. The board shall execute 
any documents required by the Pooled Money Investment Board to obtain and repay the 
loan. Any amounts loaned shall be deposited in the fund to be allocated by the board in

separate accounts for the investment of bond proceeds and for the investment earnings on 
those proceeds. The Treasurer may use or direct the use of those proceeds or earnings to 
pay any rebate, penalty, or other payment required under federal law or take any other 
action with respect to the investment and use of those bond proceeds required or desirable 
under federal law to maintain the tax-exempt status of those bonds and to obtain any other 
advantage under federal law on behalf of the funds of this state. 

79826. 

For the purposes of carrying out this chapter, the Director of Finance may authorize the 
withdrawal from the General Fund of an amount not to exceed the amount of the unsold

carrying out this chapter. Any amounts withdrawn shall be deposited in the 2016 State 
New Surface Water and Groundwater Storage Facilities Fund consistent with this chapter. 
Any money made available under this section shall be returned to the General Fund, plus an 
amount equal to the interest that the money would have earned in the Pooled Money

Article 6 ( commencing with Section 16 780) of Chapter 4 of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 2 of 
the Government Code, which is a part of the State General Obligation Bond Law. Approval 
by the voters of the state for the issuance of the bonds described in this chapter includes 
the approval of the issuance of any bonds issued to refund any bonds originally issued 
under this chapter or any previously issued refunding bonds. Any bond refunded with the 
proceeds of refunding bonds as authorized by this section may be legally defeased to the 
extent permitted by law in the manner and to the extent set forth in the resolution, as 
amended from time to time, authorizing such refunded bond.

of the California Constitution, the disbursement of these proceeds is not subject to the 
limitations imposed by that article.
