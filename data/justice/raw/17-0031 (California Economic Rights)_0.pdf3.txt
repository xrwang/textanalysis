remove all derogatory references and comments regarding late pay, defaults, evictions,

Professions Code, the entities referred to in Sections  1000 and 3600 of the Business

other state commission, department, committee, examiner, or agency that issues a 

license, certificate, credential, permit, registration, or any other authorization to engage 

in a business, occupation, or profession, or to the extent required by federal law or 

regulations, for recreational purposes. This term includes all boards, commissions, 

departments, committees, examiners, entities, and agencies that issue a license, 

certificate, credential, permit, registration, or any other authorization to engage in a 

business, occupation, or profession. The failure to specifically name a particular board, 

commission, department, committee, examiner, entity, or agency that issues a license, 

certificate, credential, permit, registration, or any other authorization to  engage in a 

business, occupation, or profession does not exclude that board, commission, 

department, committee, examiner, entity, or agency from this term. 

(3) "Certified list" means a list provided by the local child support agency to the 

Department of Child Support Services in which the local child support agency verifies, 

under penalty of perjury, that the names contained therein  are support obligors found 

to be out of compliance with a judgment or order for support in a case being enforced 

under Title IV-D of the federal Social Security Act. 

(4)  "Compliance with a judgment or order for support" means that, as set forth 

in a judgment or order for child or family support, the obligor is no more than 30 

calendar days in arrears in making payments in full for current support, in making 

05/21/17  10:10 AM 
RN  17 09940  PAGE 6 

periodic payments in full, whether court ordered or by agreement with the local child 

support agency, on a support arrearage, or in making periodic payments in full, whether 

court ordered or by agreement with the local child support agency, on a judgment for 

reimbursement for public assistance, or has obtained a judicial finding that equitable 

estoppel as provided in statute or case law precludes enforcement of the order. The 

local child support agency is authorized to use this section to enforce orders for spousal 

support only when the local child support agency is also enforcing a related child 

support obligation owed to the obligee parent by the same obligor, pursuant to Sections 

17400 and 17604. 

(5) "License" includes membership in the State Bar, and a certificate, credential, 

permit, registration, or any other authorization issued by a board that allows a person 

to engage in a business, occupation, or profession, or to  operate a commercial motor 

vehicle, including appointment and commission by the Secretary of State as a notary

and to the extent required by federal law or regulations, any license used for recreational 

purposes. This tenn includes all licenses, certificates, credentials, permits, registrations, 

or any other authorization issued by a board that allows a person to engage in a business, 

occupation, or profession. The failure to specifically name a particular type oflicense, 

certificate, credential, permit, registration, or other authorization issued by a board that 

allows a person to  engage in a business, occupation, or profession, does not exclude 

that license, certificate, credential, permit, registration, or other authorization from this 

term. 

05/21/17  10:10AM 
RN  17 09940  PAGE 7 

(6) "Licensee" means a person holding a license, certificate, credential, permit, 

registration, or other authorization issued by a board, to  engage in a business, 

occupation, or profession, or a commercial driver's license as defined in Section 15210

State as a notary public. "Licensee" also means a person holding a driv er's license 

issued by the Department of Motor Vehieles, a person holding a commercial fishing 

license issued by the Department of Fish and Game, and to the extent required by 

federal law or regulations, a person holding a license used for recreational purposes. 

This term includes all persons holding a license, certificate, credential, permit, 

registration, or any other authorization to engage in a business, occupation, or 

profession, and the failure to specifically name a particular type of license, certificate, 

credential, permit, registration, or other authorization issued by a board does not exclude 

that person from this term. For licenses issued to an entity that is not an individual 

person, "licensee" includes an individual who is either listed on the license or who 

qualifies for the license. 

(b) The local child support agency shall maintain a list ofthose persons included 

in a case being enforced under Title IV-D of the federal Social Security Act against 

whom a support order or judgment has been rendered by, or registered in, a court of 

this state, and who are not in compliance with that order or judgment. The local child 

support agency shall submit a certified list with the names, social security numbers, 

and last known addresses ofthese persons and the name, address, and telephone number 

of the local child support agency who certified the list to the department. The local 

child support agency shall verify, under penalty of perjury, that the persons listed are 

05/21/17  10:10 AM 
RN  17 09940  PAGE 8 

subject to  an order or judgment for the payment of support and that these persons are 

not in compliance with the order or judgment. The local child support agency shall 

submit to the department an updated certified list on a monthly basis. 

(c) The department shall consolidate the certified lists received from the local 

child support agencies and, within 30 calendar days of receipt, shall provide a copy of 

the consolidated list to  each board that is responsible for the regulation oflicenses, as 

specified in this section.

feasible,  as determined by the department, all boards subject to this section shall 

implement procedures to accept and process the list provided by the department, in 

accordance with this section. Notwithstanding any other law, all boards shall collect 

social security numbers or individual taxpayer identification numbers from all applicants 

for the purposes ofmatching the names ofthe certified list provided by the department 

to applicants and licensees and of responding to requests for this infonnation made by 

child support agencies. 

(e) (1) Promptly after receiving the certified consolidated list from the department, 

and prior to the issuance or renewal of a license, each board shall determine whether 

the applicant is on the most recent certified consolidated list provided by the department. 

The board shall have the authority to withhold issuance or renewal ofthe license of an 

applicant on the list. 

(2) If an applicant is on the list, the board shall immediately serve notice as 

specified in subdivision (f) on the applicant of the board's intent to withhold issuance 

or renewal of the license. The notice shall be made personally or by mail to the

complete in accordance with Section 1013  of the Code of Civil Procedure.

any applicant whose name is  on the certified list if the applicant is otherwise eligible 

for a license. 

(B) Exeept as provided in subparagraph (D), the The 150-day time period for a 

temporary license shall not be extended. Exeept as proviided in s ubparagraph (D), only 

Only one temporary license shall be issued during a regular license term and it shall 

coincide with the first  150 days of that license term. As this paragraph applies to 

commercial driver's licenses, "license term" shall be deemed to be 12 months from 

the date the application fee is received by the Department of Motor Vehicles. A license 

for the full or remainder of the license term shall be issued or renewed only upon 

compliance with this section. 

(C) In the event that a license or application for a license or the renewal of a 

license is denied pursuant to this section, any funds paid by the applicant or licensee 

shall not be refunded by the board. 

(D) This paragraph shall apply  only  in the ease of a diver's  lieense, other than 

a eommereial driver's license. Upon the request of be  local ehild support agency or 

by  order of the court upon a showing of good cause, the board shall extend a 150-day 

temporary lieense for a period not to exceed 150 extra days. 

(3) (A) The department may, when it is economically feasible for the department 

and the boards to do so as determined by the department, in cases where the department

05/21/17  10:10AM 
RN  17 09940  PAGE  10 

of compliance with a judgment or order for support for more than four months, provide 

a supplemental list of these obligors to each board with which the department has an 

interagency agreement to implement this paragraph. Upon request by the department, 

the licenses of these obligors shall be subject to suspension, provided that the licenses 

would not otherwise be eligible for renewal within six months from the date of the 

request by the department. The board shall have the authority to suspend the license 

of any licensee on this supplemental list. 

(B) If a licensee is on a supplemental list, the board shall immediately serve 

notice as specified in subdivision (f)  on the licensee that his or her license will be 

automatically suspended 150 days after notice is served, unless compliance with this 

section is achieved. The notice shall be made personally or by mail to the licensee's 

last known mailing address on file with the board. Service by mail shall be complete 

in accordance with Section 1013 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 

(C) The 150-day notice period shall not be extended. 

(D) In the event that any license is suspended pursuant to this section, any funds 

paid by the licensee shall not be refunded by the board. 

(E) This paragraph shall not apply to licenses subject to annual renewal or annual 

fee. 

(f) Notices shall be developed by each board in accordance with guidelines 

provided by the department and subject to approval by the department. The notice shall 

include the address and telephone number of the local child support agency that 

submitted the name on the certified list, and shall emphasize the necessity ofobtaining 

05/21/17  10:10AM 
RN 17 09940  PAGE  11 

a release from that local child support agency as a condition for the issuance, renewal, 

or continued valid status of a license or licenses. 

(1)  In the case of applicants not subject to paragraph (3) of subdivision (e), the 

notice shall infonn the applicant that the board shall issue a temporary license, as 

provided in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision ( e ), for 150 calendar 

days if the applicant is otherwise eligible and that upon expiration of that time period 

the license will be denied unless the board has received a release from the local child 

support agency that submitted the name on the certified list. 

(2) In the case oflicensees named on a supplemental list, the notice shall inform 

the licensee that his or her license will continue in its existing status for no more than 

150 calendar days from the date of mailing or service of the notice and thereafter will 

be suspended indefinitely unless, during the 150-day notice period, the board has 

received a release from the local child support agency that submitted the name on the 

certified list. Additionally, the notice shall inform the licensee that any license suspended 

under this section will remain so until the expiration of the remaining license term, 

unless the board receives a release along with applications and fees,  if applicable, to 

reinstate the license during the license term. 

(3) The notice shall also inform the applicant or licensee that if an application 

is denied or a license is suspended pursuant to  this section, any funds paid by the 

applicant or licensee shall not be refunded by the board. The Department of Child 

Support Services shall also develop a form that the applicant shall use to request a 

review by the local child support agency. A copy of this form shall be included with 

every notice sent pursuant to this subdivision. 

05/21/17  10:10AM 
RN  17 09940  PAGE  12 

(g) (1) Each local child support agency shall maintain review procedures 

consistent with this section to allow an applicant to have the underlying arrearage and 

any relevant defenses investigated, to provide an applicant information on the process 

of obtaining a modification of a support order, or to provide an applicant assistance in 

the establishment ofa payment schedule on arrearages ifthe circumstances so warrant. 

(2) It is the intent of the Legislature that a court or local child support agency, 

when determining an appropriate payment schedule for arrearages, base its decision 

on the facts  of the particular case and the priority of payment of child support over 

other debts. The payment schedule shall also recognize that certain expenses may be 

essential to enable an obligor to be employed. Therefore, in reaching its decision, the 

court or the local child support agency shall consider both of these goals in setting a 

payment schedule for arrearages. 

(h) If the applicant wishes to challenge the submission ofhis or her name on the 

certified list, the applicant shall make a timely written request for review to the local 

child support agency who certified the applicant's name. A request for review pursuant 

to this section shall be resolved in the same manner and timeframe provided for 

resolution of a complaint pursuant to Section 17800. The local child support agency 

shall immediately send a release to the appropriate board and the applicant, if any of 

the following conditions are met: 

(1) The applicant is  found to be in compliance or negotiates an agreement with 

the local child support agency for a payment schedule on arrearages or reimbursement. 

05/21/17  10:10 AM 
RN 17 09940  PAGE 13 

(2) The applicant has submitted a request for review, but the local child support 

agency will be unable to complete the review and send notice of its findings to the 

applicant within the time specified in Section 17800. 

(3) The applicant has filed and served a request for judicial review pursuant to 

this section, but a resolution of that review will not be made within 150 days of the 

date of service of notice pursuant to subdivision (f). This paragraph applies only if the 

delay in completing the judicial review process is not the result ofthe applicant's failure 

to act in a reasonable, timely, and diligent manner upon receiving the local child support 

agency's notice of findings. 

(4) The applicant has obtained a judicial finding of compliance as defined in this 

section. 

(i) An applicant is required to act with diligence in responding to notices from 

the board and the local child support agency with the recognition that the temporary 

license will lapse or the license suspension will go into effect after 150 days and that 

the local child support agency and, where appropriate, the court must have time to act 

within that period. An applicant's delay in acting, without good cause, which directly 

results in the inability of the local child support agency to  complete a review of the 

applicant's request or the court to hear the request for judicial review within the 150-day 

period shall not constitute the diligence required under this section which would justify 

the issuance of a release. 

G)  Except as  otherwise provided in this section, the local child support agency 

shall not issue a release ifthe applicant is not in compliance with the judgment or order 

for support. The local child support agency shall notify the applicant in writing that 

05/21/17  10:10AM 
RN 17 09940  PAGE  14 

the applicant may, by filing an order to show cause or notice of motion, request any 

or all of the following: 

(1) Judicial review of the local child support agency's decision not to issue a 

release. 

(2) A judicial determination of compliance. 

(3) A modification of the support judgment or order. 

The notice shall also contain the name and address of the court in which the 

applicant shall file the order to show cause or notice of motion and inform the applicant 

that his or her name shall remain on the ce1iified list if the applicant does not timely 

request judicial review. The applicant shall comply with all statutes and rules of court 

regarding orders to show cause and notices of motion. 

This section shall not be deemed to limit an applicant from filing an order to 

show cause or notice of motion to modify a support judgment or order or to fix  a 

payment schedule on arrearages accruing under a support judgment or order or to obtain 

a court finding of compliance with a judgment or order for support. 

(k) The request for judicial review of the local child support agency's decision 

shall state the grounds for which review is requested and judicial review shall be limited 

to those stated grounds. The court shall hold an evidentiary hearing within 20 calendar 

days of the filing of the request for review. Judicial review of the local child support 

agency's decision shall be limited to  a determination of each of the following issues: 

(1) Whether there is a support judgment, order, or payment schedule on arrearages 

or reimbursement. 

05/21/17  10:10AM 
RN 17 09940  PAGE 15 

(2) Whether the petitioner is the obligor covered by the support judgment or 

order. 

(3) Whether the support obligor is or is not in compliance with the judgment or 

order of support. 

(4) (A) The extent to which the needs of the obligor, taking into account the 

obligor's payment history and the current circumstances of both the obligor and the 

obligee, warrant a conditional release as  described in this subdivision. 

(B) The request for judicial review shall be served by the applicant upon the 

local child support agency that submitted the applicant's name on the certified list 

within seven calendar days of the filing of the petition. The court has the authority to 

uphold the action, unconditionally release the license, or conditionally release the 

license. 

(C) If the judicial review results in a finding by the court that the obligor is in 

compliance with the judgment or order for support, the local child support agency shall 

immediately send a release in accordance with subdivision([) to the appropriate board 

and the applicant. Ifthe judicial review results in a finding by the court that the needs 

ofthe obligor warrant a conditional release, the court shall make findings of fact stating 

the basis for the release and the payment necessary to satisfy the unrestricted issuance 

or renewal of the license without prejudice to a later judicial determination of the 

amount of support arrearages, including interest, and shall specify payment tenns, 

compliance with which are necessary to  allow the release to remain in effect. 

([)  The department shall prescribe release forms for use by local child support 

agencies. When the obligor is in compliance, the local child support agency shall mail 

05/21/17  10:10AM 
RN 17 09940  PAGE  16 

to the applicant and the appropriate board a release stating that the applicant is in 

compliance. The receipt of a release shall serve to notify the applicant and the board 

that, for the purposes of this section, the applicant is in compliance with the judgment 

or order for support. Any board that has received a release from the local child support 

agency pursuant to this subdivision shall process the release within five business days 

of its receipt. 

If the local child support agency determines subsequent to the issuance of a 

release that the applicant is once again not in compliance with a judgment or order for 

support, or with the terms of repayment as described in this subdivision, the local child 

support agency may notify the board, the obligor, and the department in a fonnat 

prescribed by the department that the obligor is not in compliance. 

The department may, when it is economically feasible for the department and 

the boards to develop an automated process for complying with this subdivision, notify 

the boards in a manner prescribed by the department, that the obligor is once again not 

in compliance. Upon receipt of this notice, the board shall immediately notify the 

obligor on a form prescribed by the department that the obligor's license will be 

suspended on a specific date, and this date shall be no longer than 30 days from the 

date the fonn is mailed. The obligor shall be further notified that the license will remain 

suspended until a new release is issued in accordance with subdivision (h). Nothing in 

this section shall be deemed to  limit the obligor from seeking judicial review of 

suspension pursuant to the procedures described in subdivision (k). 

(m) The department may enter into interagency agreements with the state agencies 

that have responsibility for the administration of boards necessary to implement this 

05/21/17  10:10AM 
RN  17 09940  PAGE  17 

section, to the extent that it is cost effective to implement this section. These agreements 

shall provide for the receipt by the other state agencies and boards of federal funds to 

cover that portion of costs allowable in federal law and regulation and incurred by the 

state agencies and boards in implementing this section. Notwithstanding any other 

provision of law, revenue generated by a board or state agency shall be used to fund 

the nonfederal share of costs incurred pursuant to this section. These agreements shall 

provide that boards shall reimburse the department for the nonfederal share of costs 

incurred by the department in implementing this section. The boards shall reimburse 

the department for the nonfederal share of costs incurred pursuant to this section from 

moneys collected from applicants and licensees. 

(n) Notwithstanding any other law, in order for the boards subject to this section 

to be reimbursed for the costs incurred in administering its provisions, the boards may, 

with the approval of the appropriate department director, levy on all licensees and 

applicants a surcharge on any fee  or fees collected pursuant to law,  or,  alternatively, 

with the approval of the appropriate department director, levy on the applicants or 

licensees named on a certified list or supplemental list, a special fee. 

(o) The process described in subdivision (h) shall constitute the sole 

administrative remedy for contesting the issuance of a temporary license or the denial 

or suspension of a license under this section. The procedures specified in the 

administrative adjudication provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act ( Chapter 

4.5 ( commencing with Section 11400) and Chapter 5 ( commencing with Section 11500) 

of Part 1 of Division 3 ofTitle 2 ofthe Government Code) shall not apply to the denial,

RN  17 09940  PAGE  18 

suspension, or failure to issue or renew a license or the issuance of a temporary license 

pursuant to this section. 

(p) In furtherance of the public policy of increasing child support enforcement 

and collections, on or before November 1, 1995, the State Department of Social Services 

shall make a report to the Legislature and the Governor based on data collected by the 

boards and the district attorneys in a format prescribed by the State Department of 

Social Services. The report shall contain all of the following: 

(1) The number of delinquent obligors certified by district attorneys under this 

section. 

(2) The number of support obligors who also were applicants or licensees subject 

to this section. 

(3) The number of new licenses and renewals that were delayed, temporary
