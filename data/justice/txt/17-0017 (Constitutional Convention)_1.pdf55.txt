SECTION 1. TITLE: CALIFORNIA CALLS FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION 
("CAL CON CON") 

This measure shall be known as the California Calls for a Constitutional Convention ("Cal Con 
Con"). 

SECTION 2. Findings and Declarations: 

The current relationship between the Federal Government of The United States of America and 
California prevents California, and other states, from taking ownership over their future and must 
be revised. 

1. 	 Given that "California is - and must always be - a refuge ofjustice and opportunity for 

people of all ages, backgrounds and aspirations - regardless of how you look, where you 
live, what language you speak, or who you love;" 

2. 	 Given that the world has changed dramatically since 1787, and over the next Century 

California will continue to invent the future, be it in Entertainment, IT, Medical 
discoveries, Environmental Protection, Global Climate Disaster Mitigation, or Civil Rights 
& Liberties; 

3. 	 Given that a Californian's vote has one seventieth the weight of a citizen of Wyoming in 

the US Senate and has become functionally irrelevant in presidential elections; 

4. 	 Given that California receives approximately seventy-five cents in federal funding back for 

every dollar Californians pay to the federal government in taxes, as compared to the USA 
States average federal return in funding from taxes of $1.22/dollar; 

5. 	 Given that the US federal  government has seen increasing gridlock and citizens across the 

country feel poorly represented by the federal government; 

6. 	 Given that California's government and people increasingly want to chart their own path 

on issues ranging from - but not limited to - immigration, civil representation and 
environmental protection and, given the US Constitution expressly designates states as 
sovereign entities; 

7. 	 Given that Article V of the Constitution of the United States authorizes a process to 

propose amendments to the United States Constitution through a Convention of the States; 

8. 	 Given that the authors of the original 1787 Constitution expressly included an article five 

constitutional convention as a vehicle for state governments to rein in the potential for 
federal tyranny and ensure America never again had a king; 

9. 	 Given that the tenth Amendment of the US  Constitution reserves all powers not expressly 

enumerated to the federal government to the states; 

10.  Given that throughout our nation's history, there have been over 700 applications from 

state governments to call an article five constitutional convention including applications 
from all fifty states; 

11.  Given that the Congress has failed to act despite the express constitutional direction of 

Article Five of the US  Constitution; 

12. Given that the 1787 constitutional convention was only retroactively endorsed by the 

Congress under the previous Articles of Confederation; 

13.  Given that California has successfully implemented the principle of subsidiarity, devolving 

power more locally under the leadership of Governor Edmund G.  Brown; 

14.  Given that Californians have expressed their interest in constitutional reform to address the 

influx of money in politics in the wake of Citizens United vs.  FEC; 

15.  Given that California has a deep commitment to open and pluralistic values protecting the 
civil rights of all Californians as articulated in Finding #1  above quoting from California's 
state legislative leaders; 

16. Given that California Governor Jerry Brown has successfully led California to achieve 

greater economic growth than the nation as  a whole since the great depression; 

17.  Given further that under Governor Brown's leadership, California: 

1. 	 "Increased - by tens of billions - support for our public schools and universities. 
2. 	 Provided health insurance to over five  million more Californians. 
3. 	 Raised the minimum wage. 
4. 	 Reduced prison overcrowding and reformed our system of crime and punishment. 
5. 	 Made California a world leader in the fight against climate change. 
6. 	 Passed a water bond. 
7. 	 Built up a rainy day fund. 
8. 	 And closed a huge $27 billion deficit." 

18. Given that in addition to these successes, Governor Brown has served as both California' s 

youngest and oldest governor, unique among all current sitting governors; 

19. Given that California has a long tradition of leading America - and indeed the world - in 

social, political, environmental and technological advancement & protection; 

20.  Given that Californian's believe in the equality and inherent dignity of all persons; 
21 . Given that California's participation in an article five constitutional convention is  an 

excellent opportunity to advance specific issues dear to the hearts of many Californians, 
including, but not limited to: 

1. 	 Protecting citizens from discrimination, harm or unfair treatment, from individuals 

or groups. 

2. 	 Our state government unwaveringly protecting civilians rights to freedom of 

expression and assembly as well as the equality of opportunity for all Californians. 

3. 	 Limiting corporate personhood for purposes of campaign finance and political 

speech; 

4. 	 Requiring women, LGBTQ and all people - regardless of ethnicity, race, national 

origin, gender - to receive equal pay for equal work; 

5. 	 Requiring the federal government to allocate funding to the states according to the 

amount each respective state paid in federal taxes; 

6. 	 Enabling CA to negotiate binding agreements with other nations, subnational 

states, and nongovernmental organizations to limit greenhouse gas emissions and 
other environmentally threatening business practices; 

7. 	 Enabling CA to negotiate binding agreements with concerned and responding 

governments, and other partners, dedicated to mitigating the impacts of worldwide 
refugees, loss of lifestyles and land, due to impacts of Climate Change. 

8. 	 Should it be deemed necessary by the majority CA population, in order to defend 

California's progressive values, civic values and environmental concerns, we must 
create a clear and reasonable path for individual States to become independent, so 
that CA can secede, if they so choose; 

22.  Given that California was seized undemocratically and annexed by the US in 1846 in an 

act of naked imperial aggression; 

23.  We believe that justice for all requires constant vigilance and a thorough examination of 

laws and governmental actions that disproportionately impact diverse segments of society. 
These beliefs depend on resolutely defending these Californian values, which support 
every individual's hopes and dreams for the future; 

24. California hereby resolves to call a constitutional convention under Article Five of the US 
Constitution to advance the cause of California and the freedom of all American states to 
take ownership of their future.
