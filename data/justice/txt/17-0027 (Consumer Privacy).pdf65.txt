THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT OF 2018 

SEC. 1.  Title. 

This measure shall be known and may be cited as "The California Consumer Privacy Act 
of2018." 

SEC. 2.  Findings and Declarations. 

The People of the State of California hereby find and declare all  of the following: 

In  1972, California voters amended the California Constitution to include the right of 

A. 
privacy among the "inalienable" rights of all people.  Voters acted in response to the accelerating 
encroachment on personal freedom and security caused by increased data collection in 
contemporary society.  The amendment established a legal and enforceable right of privacy for 
every Californian.  Fundamental to this right of privacy is the ability of individuals to control the 
use of their personal infonnation.  As a Californian, you retain your reasonable expectation of 
privacy even when you share your personal information with a third party. 

Since California voters approved the right of privacy, the California Legislature has 

B. 
adopted specific mechanisms to safeguard Californians' privacy, including the Online Privacy 
Protection Act, the Privacy Rights for California Minors in the Digital World Act, and Shine the 
Light, a California law intended to give Californians the "who, what, where, and when" of how 
businesses handle consumers'  personal information.  But technology has continued to advance 
exponentially and business practices have changed dramatically. 

C. 
Many businesses collect personal information from California consumers using hundreds 
of tracking and collection devices.  They not only know where you live and how many children 
you have, but also how fast you drive and your personality, sleep habits, biometric and health 
information, financial information, current location, and social networks, to name just a few 
categories.  California law has not kept pace with these developments. 

Businesses drive the market for consumers' personal information, and they profit from 

D. 
buying and selling your personal information and using it for commercial purposes. 

The proliferation of personal information over which consumers lack control has limited 

E. 
Californians' ability to properly protect and safeguard their privacy.  Businesses use this personal 
information for their own purposes, including selling it to,  and sharing it with, other businesses 
for their commercial purposes without your knowledge, and using it to offer you a different price 
or service, target you with ads, or to track your location, habits, and preferences for future 
commercial use.  Often, you may not even know that these records exist and cannot determine 
who has access to them or to whom they are being sold or with whom they are being shared. 

At the same time, you are in a position of relative dependence on businesses that collect 

F. 
your information.  It is easy for companies to monitor what you do as they collect everÂ­
increasing amounts and categories of data about you.  But it is difficult for you to monitor 
business operations or prevent companies from  using your personal information for the 
companies' financial  benefit.  Providing information to a company is not the same as making it 

1 


available to the public generally, and you have a reasonable expectation that businesses will 
respect your privacy. 

G. 
You should have the right to know what personal information businesses collect about 
you and your children and what they do with it, including how businesses use that information 
and who they sell it to. 

You should also be able to control the use of your,  and your children's, personal 

H. 
information, and be able to stop businesses from selling your information or sharing it for 
commercial purposes.  Your decision to tell a business to stop selling your personal information 
or sharing it for commercial purposes should not affect the price or quality of the goods or 
services you receive.  It is possible for businesses both to provide a high level of service and to 
respect your privacy. 

SEC. 3.  Purpose and Intent. 

In enacting this Act, it is the purpose and intent of the people of the State of California to further 
operationalize the constitutional right of privacy by giving consumers an effective way to control 
their personal information, thereby affording better protection of their own privacy and 
autonomy, by: 

Giving California consumers the right to know what categories of personal information a 

A. 
business has collected about them and their children. 

Giving California consumers the right to know what a business has done with that 

B. 
information, including what information it has sold, or shared for commercial purposes, and to 
whom it has been sold or shared. 

Requiring a business to disclose to a California consumer ifit sells or shares any of the 

C. 
consumer's personal information and allowing the consumer to tell the business to stop selling or 
sharing the consumer's personal information for the business or the buyer's commercial 
purposes. 

Preventing a business from  denying or changing a service or charging more if a 

D. 
California consumer refuses to allow the business to sell the consumer's personal information or 
share it for commercial purposes.

1798.112.  Construction. 

1798.112.  This Act is intended to operationalize the constitutional right of privacy and to 
supplement existing laws relating to consumers' personal information, including but not limited 
to the California Internet Privacy Act (chapter 22 of Division 8 of the Business and Professions 
Code, commencing with section 22575) and the California Shine the Light Act (Title 1.81  of 
Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code, commencing with section 1798.80).  The provisions of 
this Act are not limited to information collected electronically or over the Internet, but apply to 
the collection and sale, or sharing for commercial purposes, of all  personal information collected 
by a business from consumers.  Wherever possible, existing law relating to consumers' personal 
information should be construed to harmonize with the provisions of this Act, but in the event of 
a conflict between existing law and the provisions of this Act, the provisions of the law that 
afford the greatest protection for the right of privacy shall control. 

SEC. 4.14.  Section 1798.113 is  added to  the Civil Code, to read: 

1798.113.  Imposition of Additional Privacy Safeguards. 

1798.113.  Nothing in this Act shall  prevent a city,  county, city and county, municipality, or local 
agency from  safeguarding the constitutional right of privacy by imposing additional 

14 

requirements regarding the collection and sale, or sharing for commercial purposes, of 
consumers'  personal information by businesses provided that the requirement does not prevent a 
person from  complying with this Act. 

SEC. 4.15.  Section 1798.114 is added to the Civil Code, to read: 

1798.114.  Regulations. 

1798.114.  (a) The Attorney General shall adopt regulations to further the purposes of this Act, 
including but not limited to: 

(1) Adding additional categories to those enumerated in subdivision (1) of section 1 798.106 and 
subdivision (c) of section 1798.104.  Upon receipt of a request made by a California city attorney 
or district attorney to add a new category or categories, the Attorney General shall promulgate a 
regulation to add such category or categories unless the Attorney General concludes, based on 
factual or legal findings,  that there is a compelling reason not to add the category or categories. 
The Attorney General may also add additional categories to those enumerated in subdivision (I) 
of section  1798.106 and subdivision (c) of section 1798.104 in response to a petition filed 
pursuant to section 11340.6 of the Government Code; 

(2) Adding additional items to the definition of "unique identifiers" to address changes in 
technology; 

(3) Establishing any exceptions necessary to comply with state and federal law; 

(4) Establishing rules and procedures pursuant to which a business complies with the 
requirements in subdivision (b) of section 1798.105 and the notice requirement in paragraph (2) 
of subdivision (a) of section 1798.105; 

(5) Adjusting the monetary thresholds in subparagraphs (b) and ( c) of paragraph (1) of 
subdivision (b) of section  1798.106 in January  of every odd-numbered year to reflect any 
increase in the Consumer Price Index; and 

(6) Establishing rules, procedures, and any exceptions necessary to ensure that the notices and 
information that businesses are required to provide pursuant to this Act are accessible to 
consumers with disabilities, and are available in the language primarily used to interact with the 
consumer. 

(b) The Attorney General shall be precluded from  adopting regulations that limit or reduce the 
number or scope of categories of personal information enumerated in subdivision ( c) of 
section 1798.104 and subdivision (1)  of section 1798.106, or that limit or reduce the number or 
scope of categories added pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (a), except as necessary to 
comply with paragraph (3) of subdivision (a).  The Attorney General shall also be precluded 
from reducing the scope of the definition of "unique identifiers." 

(c) The Attorney General shall adopt any regulations the Attorney General deems necessary to 

implement this measure within six months of the date of the election at which it is adopted. 

Notwithstanding the California Administrative Procedure Act (APA),  and in order to facilitate 


15 

the implementation of this Act, the Attorney General may adopt interim regulations without 
compliance with the procedures set forth in the APA.  The interim regulations shall remain in 
effect for 270 days unless earlier superseded by regulations adopted pursuant to the APA. 

SEC. 5.  Amendment. 

This Act shall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes.  The provisions of this Act may 
not be amended before the measure is approved by the voters.  The provisions of this Act may be 
amended so long as such amendments are consistent with and further the intent of this Act to 
protect the right of Californians to control the use of their personal information by a statute that 
is passed by a two-thirds vote of the members of each house of the Legislature and signed by the 
Governor.  In addition, the Legislature may amend subdivision (c) of section  1798.109 and 
subdivision (b) of section 1798.111, as specified in subdivision ( d) of section  1798. l 09, by a 
majority vote of the members of each house of the Legislature and signed by the Governor. 

SEC. 6.  Severability. 

If any provision of this measure, or part of this measure, or the application of any provision or 
part to any person or circumstances, is for any reason held to be invalid, the remaining 
provisions, or applications of provisions, shall not be affected, but shall remain in full force and 
effect, and to this end the provisions of this measure are severable.  If a court were to find in a 
final,  unreviewable judgment that the exclusion of one or more entities or activities from the 
applicability of the Act renders the Act unconstitutional, those exceptions should be severed and 
the Act should be made applicable to the entities or activities formerly exempt from the Act.  It is 
the intent of the voters that this chapter would have been enacted regardless of whether an 
invalid provision had been included or an invalid application had been made. 

SEC. 7.  Conflicting Initiatives. 

(a) In the event that this measure and another measure addressing the privacy of personal 
information shall appear on the same statewide ballot, the provisions of the other measure or 
measures shall be deemed to be in conflict with this measure.  In the event that this measure 
receives a greater number of affirmative votes than a measure deemed to be in conflict with it, 
the provisions of this measure shall prevail in their entirety, and the other measure or measures 
shall be null  and void. 

(b) If this measure is approved by the voters but superseded by law by any other conflicting 
measure approved by voters at the same election, and the conflicting ballot measure is later held 
invalid, this measure shall be self-executing and given full force and effect. 

SEC. 8.  Standing. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the State, government agency, or any of its 
officials fail to defend the constitutionality of this Act, following its approval by the voters, any 
other government agency, the proponent, or in his or her absence, any citizen of this State shall 
have the authority to intervene in any court action challenging the constitutionality of this Act for 
the purpose of defending its constitutionality, whether such action is in trial  court, on appeal, or 
on discretionary review by the Supreme Court of California and/or the Supreme Court of the 

16 

United States.  The reasonable fees and costs of defending the action shall be a charge on funds 
appropriated to the California Department of Justice, which shall be satisfied promptly. 

SEC. 9.  Anti-Avoidance Provision. 

If a series of steps or transactions were component parts of a single transaction intended from the 
beginning to be taken for purposes of avoiding the reach of this Act, a court may disregard the 
intermediate steps or transactions for purposes of effectuating the purposes of this Act. 

SEC. 10.  Non-Waiver. 

Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in any way a 
consumer's rights under this Act shall be deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and 
unenforceable.  This section shall not prevent a consumer from:  declining to request information 
from a business; declining to opt out of a business's sale of the consumer's personal information, 
or its sharing of that information for commercial purposes; or authorizing a business to sell the 
consumer's personal information, or sharing it for commercial purposes, after previously opting 
out. 

SEC. 11.  Liberal Construction. 

This Act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes. 

SEC. 12.  Savings Clause. 

This Act is intended to supplement federal  law, where permissible, but shall not apply where 
such application is preempted by, or in conflict with, federal  law, or the California Constitution. 

SEC. 13.  Effective Date. 

This Act shall only apply to personal information collected or sold by a business on or after 6 

months from the effective date.
