LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST 

SB  1446, Hancock. Firearms: magazine capacity. 

(1)  Existing law prohibits the sale, gift, and loan ofa large-capacity magazine. A violation of this prohibition is punishable as a 
misdemeanor with specified penalties or as a felony. 

This bill would, commencing July  1,  20 I 7, make it an  infraction punishable by a fine not to exceed $100 for the first offense, by 
a fine not to exceed $250 for the 2nd offense, and by a fine not to exceed $500 for the 3rd or subsequent offense, for a person to 
possess any large-capacity magazine, regardless of the date the magazine was acquired. The bill would require a person in lawful 
possession of a large-capacity magazine prior to July  l, 2017, to dispose ofthe magazine, as provided. 

By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. 

(2) Existing law creates various exceptions to the crime described in paragraph (1) above, which include, but are not limited to, 
the sale of, giving of,  lending of, importation into this state of, or purchase of. any large-capacity magazine to or by the holder of 
a special weapons permit for use as a prop for a motion picture, or any federal,  state, county, city and county, or city agency that 
is charged with the enforcement of any law. for use by agency employees in the discharge oftheir ofl'icial duties, whether on or 
off duty, and where the use is authorized by the agency and is within the course and scope of their duties. 

This bill would make conforming changes to those exceptions by including possession of a large-capacity magazine in those 
provisions and would establish additional exceptions to the crime described in paragraph (1) above,  including exceptions to allow 
licensed gunsmiths and honorably retired sworn peace ofl'icers to possess a large-capacity magazine. 

The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the 
state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. 

This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
