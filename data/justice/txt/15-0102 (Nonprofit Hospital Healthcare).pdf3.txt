CHARITY CARE ACT OF 2016 

This initiative measure is submitted to the people in accordance with the provisions of 

Article II, Section 8, of the California Constitution. 

This initiative measure amends and adds sections to the Corporations Code and the 

Revenue and Taxation Code; therefore, existing provisions proposed to be deleted are printed in 
strikeout type and new provisions proposed to be added are printed in italic type to indicate that 
they are new. 

SECTION 1.  Name. 

This act shall be known as the "Charity Care Act of2016." 

SEC. 2.  Findings and Purpose. 

This act, adopted by the people ofthe State of California, makes the following Findings 

and has the following Purpose: 

A.  The People make the following findings: 

(1)  Access to health care services is of vital concern to the people of this State. 

(2)  Although counties provide certain health care services to needy patients, the counties are not 
fully able to serve the public's need for affordable health care. 

(3)  Private nonprofit hospitals currently meet certain needs of needy patients through charity 
care and provision of discounted health care services.  Public recognition of the unique role of 
nonprofit hospitals has resulted in favorable tax treatment of the hospitals, which is a significant 
benefit for those hospitals.  In exchange, nonprofit hospitals assume a social obligation to further 
the public interest in ensuring that needy patients continue to have access to charity care and 
discounted health care services. 

(4)  Existing requirements oflaw do not adequately ensure that nonprofit hospitals provide 
charity care to the communities they serve in amounts that are appropriate in light of the 
significant benefits the hospitals receive from the State.  Nor do existing requirements oflaw 
adequately identify standards for appropriate amounts of charity care and discounted health care 
services that nonprofit hospitals should provide in exchange for the benefits they receive from 
the State. 

B.  It is the purpose of this Act to ensure that nonprofit hospitals that receive significant benefits 
from the State, including favorable tax treatment, provide appropriate levels of charity care and 
discounted health care services to needy patients.

(b)  If a request for review raises a significant question regarding whether some or all of the 
costs a nonprofit hospital has identified as charity care are properly designated as charity care, 
the Attorney General shall grant the request for review.  In assessing whether a request for 
review raises a significant question,  the Attorney General may consider the amount of costs at 
issue and whether the question is one that may affect other nonprofit hospitals' calculations of 
charity care.  The Attorney General shall notifY the public,  the requestor,  and the nonprofit 
hospital whose costs are the subject of the request for review of its decision to grant or deny a 
request for review.

SEC. 4. 

Section 504 7.5  of the Corporations Code is amended to read: 

5047.5 

(a)  The Legislature finds and declares that the services of directors and officers of nonprofit 
corporations who serve without compensation are critical to the efficient conduct and 
management of the public service and charitable affairs of the people of California.  The 
willingness of volunteers to offer their services has been deterred by a perception that their 
personal assets are at risk for these activities.  The unavailability and unaffordability of 
appropriate liability insurance makes it difficult for these corporations to protect the personal 
assets of their volunteer decisionmakers with adequate insurance.  It is the public policy of this 
state to provide incentive and protection to the individuals who perform these important 
functions. 

(b)  Except as provided in this section, no cause of action for monetary damages shall arise 
against any person serving without compensation as a director or officer of a nonprofit 
corporation subject to Part 2 (commencing with Section 511 0), Part 3 (commencing with 
Section 711 0), or Part 4 (commencing with Section 911 0) of this division on account of any 
negligent act or omission occurring (1) within the scope of that person's duties as a director 
acting as a board member, or within the scope of that person's duties as an officer acting in an 
official capacity; (2) in good faith;  (3) in a manner that the person believes to be in the best 
interest of the corporation; and (4) is in the exercise of his or her policymakingjudgment. 

9 

(c)  This section shall not limit the liability of a director or officer for any of the following: 

(1)  Self-dealing transactions, as described in Sections 5233  and 9243. 
(2)  Conflicts of interest, as described in Section 7233. 
(3)  Actions described in Sections 5237, 5944, 7236, and 9245. 
( 4)  In the case of a charitable trust, an action or proceeding against a trustee brought by a 

beneficiary of that trust. 

(5)  Any action or proceeding brought by the Attorney General. 
( 6)  Intentional, wanton, or reckless acts, gross negligence, or an action based on fraud, 

oppression, or malice. 

(7)  Any action brought under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 16700) of Part 2 of 

Division 7 of the Business and Professions Code. 

(d)  This section only applies to nonprofit corporations organized to provide religious, charitable, 
literary, educational, scientific, social, or other forms of public service that are exempt from 
federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(3) or 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

(e)  This section applies only if the nonprofit corporation maintains a liability insurance policy 
with an amount of coverage of at least the following amounts: 

(1)  If the corporation's annual budget is less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), the 

minimum required amount is five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000). 

(2)  If the corporation's annual budget equals or exceeds fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), the 

minimum required amount is one million dollars ($1,000,000). 

This section applies only if the claim against the director or officer can also be made directly 
against the corporation and a liability insurance policy is applicable to the claim.  If that policy is 
found to cover the damages caused by the director or officer, no cause of action as provided in 
this section shall be maintained against the director or officer. 

(f)  For the purposes of this section, the payment of actual expenses incurred in attending 
meetings or otherwise in the execution of the duties of a director or officer shall not constitute 
compensation. 

(g)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of a nonprofit corporation for 
any negligent act or omission of a director, officer, employee, agent, or servant occurring within 
the scope of his or her duties. 

(h)  This section does not apply to any corporation that unlawfully restricts membership, 
services, or benefits conferred on the basis of political affiliation, age, or any characteristic listed 
or defined in subdivision (b) or (e) of Section 51  of the Civil Code. 

(i)  This section does not apply to any volunteer director or officer who receives compensation 
from the corporation in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, as an employee.

subject or matter covered by Sections 9660 to 9690, inclusive; (2) to initiate criminal procedures 
to prosecute violations of the criminal laws, and upon conviction seek restitution as punishment; 
and (3) to represent as legal counsel any other agency or department of the State of California 
expressly empowered to act with respect to the status of religious corporations, or expressly 
empowered to regulate activities in which religious corporations, as well as other entities, may 
engage. 

(d)  Where property has been solicited and received from the general public, based on a 
representation that it would be used for a specific charitable purpose other than general support 
of the corporation's activities, and has been used in a manner contrary to that specific charitable 
purpose for which the property was solicited, the Attorney General may institute an action to 
enforce the specific charitable purpose for which the property was solicited; provided ( 1) that 
before bringing such action the Attorney General shall notify the corporation that an action will 
be brought unless the corporation takes immediate steps to correct the improper diversion of 
funds,  and (2) that in the event it becomes impractical or impossible for the corporation to devote 
the property to the specified charitable purpose, or that the directors or members of the 
corporation in good faith expressly conclude and record in writing that the stated purpose for 
which the property was contributed is no longer in accord with the policies of the corporation, 
then the directors or members of the corporation may approve or ratify in good faith the use of 
such property for the general purposes of the corporation rather than for the specific purpose for 
which it was contributed. 

As used in this section, "solicited from the general public" means solicitations directed to the 
general public, or to any individual or group of individuals who are not directly affiliated with 
the soliciting organization and includes, but is not limited to, instances where property has been 
solicited on an individual basis, such as door to door, direct mail, face to face, or similar 
solicitations, as well as solicitations on a more general level to the general public, or a portion 
thereof, such as  through the media, including newspapers, television, radio, or similar 
solicitations. 

(e)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect any individual rights of action which were 
accorded under law in existence prior to the enactment of Chapter 1324 of the Statutes of 1980. 

11 

As used in this section, "individual rights of action" include only rights enforceable by private 
individuals and do not include any right of action of a public officer in an official capacity 
regardless of whether the officer brings the action on behalf of a private individual. 

(f)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require express statutory authorization by the 
California Legislature of any otherwise lawful and duly authorized action by any agency of local 
government.
