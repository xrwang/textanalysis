'In re:  "Right to a Custodial Trial by Jury for California Parents" 

The revised  proposed amendment to California Family Code ยง3022 is as follows: 

"This Section shall be known as  Luke's Law.  The court may, during the pendency of a proceeding or at 

any time thereafter, make an order for the custody of a child during minority that seems necessary or 

proper or a party may demand a trialby jury.  In a jury trial, the party is entitled to a verdict by the jury 

and the court may not contravene a jury verdict on the issue of: 


(a)  The appointment of joint custody; 
(b)  The appointment of joint legal custody; 
(c)  The appointment of joint physical custody; 

{d)  The.appointment of sole legal custody; 

(e)  The appointment of sole physical custody. 

The  proposed title is "Luke's Law,  parents' right to a custodial trial by jury" 

The proposed summary is "This change to Family Code ยง3022 will allow any parent to have legal and/or 

physical custodial right to their minor child(ren) summarily decided by a jury, but leaves their visitation 

rights with their minor child(ren) open to further litigation. Parents in Texas currently have this right.
