Assembly Bill No. 1695 

CHAPTER47 

An act to amend Sections 148.5 and  29805 of the Penal Code, relating to fiream1s. 

[ Approved by Governor  July 01, 2016. Filed with Secretary of State  July 01, 2016.] 

LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST 

.'\B 1695, Bonta. Firearms: false reports of stolen firearms. 

(l) Existing law makes it a misdemeanor to make a false report to a peace officer, or to a person who is employed by a law 
enforcement agency, as specified, that a felony or misdemeanor has been committed, knowing the report to be false. 

This bill would make that prohibition applicable to a person who reports to certain individuals and peace officers that a firearm 
has been lost or stolen, knowing the report to be false.  By changing the definition of an existing crime, this bill would impose a 
state-mandated local program. The bill would also make it a misdemeanor for a person convicted of violating this provision to 
o~n a firearm within 10 years of the conviction. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state­
mandated local program. 

(2) This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 29805 of the Penal Code, proposed by AB 1176, that would become 
operative only if AB  1176 and this bill are both chaptered and become effective on or before January  l, 2017, and this bill  is 
chaptered last. 

(3) The Califomia Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by 
the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. 

This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
