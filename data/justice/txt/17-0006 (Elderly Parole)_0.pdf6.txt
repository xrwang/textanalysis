Proposed Penal Code Title 2.4, Section 3055 

Elderly Inmate Parole 

(a) The Elderly Parole Program is hereby established, to be administered by the Board of Parole 
Hearings. 

(b)  A prisoner shall be considered for parole under the Elderly Parole Program if he or she meets 
both of the following conditions: 
(1)  The prisoner is 80 years of age or older. 
(2)  The prisoner has served 10 years of continued incarceration on his or her current sentence on 
a detenninate or indeterminate sentence. 

(c)  When considering the release of a prisoner specified by subdivision (b) pursuant to  Section 
3041, the board shall give special consideration to whether age, time served, and diminished 
physical condition, if any, have reduced the elderly prisoner's risk for future violence. 

(d)  When scheduling a parole suitability hearing date pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 
3041.5 or when considering a request for an advance hearing pursuant to subdivision ( d) of 
Section 3041.5, the board shall consider whether the prisoner meets or will meet the criteria 
specified in subdivision (b ). 

(e)  If the prisoner is found suitable for parole under the Elderly Parole Program, the board shall 
release the individual on parole as provided in Section 3 041. 

(f)  This section does not apply to prisoners sentenced to death or to imprisonment for life 
without the possibility of parole, or to any inmate who is serving a sentence for which parole, 
pursuant to subdivision (b ), is prohibited by any initiative statute.  The provisions of this section 
shall not be constrned to alter or diminish the rights conferred under the Victim's Bill of Rights 
Act of 2008:  Marsy's Law.
