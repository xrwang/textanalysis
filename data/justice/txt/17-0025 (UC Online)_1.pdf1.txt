courses online at cost.

public's right to audit all publicly owned postsecondary courses and programs

possibly enroll into UC;  to encourage the use of open educational resources;  to 
require that tuition at the new university include course books and materials;  to 
lower the cost of all UCO, UC, CSU, and CCC books- by creating large buyers

prices;  to require tuition charged to students at the new university reflect actual 
costs and expenses, only;  to create funding for merit based in-state Division II 
student scholarships, student food pantries, and need based in-state student 
housing; to require fully transparent tuition cost accounting at UCO; and, to 
authorize full funding of UCO.

(b) Notivithstanding Section 9, the Regents and the UCO President, appointed pursuant to 
subdivision (e), shall _establish a separate o:nline university-with its own president, faculty, 
budget, academic senate, and endowment - consisting of all publicly owned postsecondary 
courses, programs, and digital libraries to be known as the "University of California 
Online."  UCO will be comprised of the following tivo academic divisions: 

(1)  Division I, the "free'' division, shall authorize the public to audit all UCO courses, 
programs, and digital libraries at no cost and to question professors, access course 
books, course materials, and labs at cost. 

(2) Division II, the "for-credit" division, shall authorize public access and attendance of 
all UCO for-credit courses and programs, including courses with labs.  Students may 
earn full credit and full academic degrees.  Enrollment shall be open to all who apply. 
Students may complete courses at their own pace.  Division II shall have tuition and, if 
applicable, lab fees and out-of-state fees.  Over time, tuition for Division II shall be set 
to cover all costs of both divisions.  Tuition shall vary by course.  Specific course tuition 
after reflecting UCO fixed, start up, and creation costs on a prorated basis, shall be 
based on the variable costs to create, deliver, and teach that specific course, amortized 
by the number of students.  UCO may only pass on legitimate costs to students.  Tuition 
and lab fees charged to students shall not exceed projected costs.  Specific course tuition 
shall include specific course books and materials.  Especially in the initial startup years: 
the UCO President shall base tuition on estimated costs and projections; with regards 
to establishing the fixed cost portion of tuition, the UCO President shall amortize long 
term fixed costs by the duration of the financing bonds authorized in paragraph (h). 
UCO's line item cost accounting shall be transparent and publically viewable online. 

(c) The Regents and UCO President shall ensure UCO Division II course curriculum is at 
least as rigorous as UC's, fully accredited, and fungible with UC.  The Trustees and the 
Governors shall ensure that UCO Division II course credit is accepted as fully accredited 
course credit in their respective segments.  If a CSU and CCC course ( or any other 
university course) meets UCO's high standard, the Regents and the UCO President shall 
accept that course credit as UCO course credit. 

(d) The Regents and the UCO President shall encourage, but not require, the use of lower 
cost or free open educational resources.  The Regents and the UCO President shall 
establish a nonprofit textbook bookstore - to be known as the UCO Bookstore - of all 
UCO, UC, CSU, and CCC textbooks.  The UCO Bookstore shall buy back used student 
books at a fair market price. 

(e) The Regents shall appoint the UCO President with full power to create, implement, 
administer, and lead UCO.  If the office of the UCO President is vacant for 180 days for 
any reason, the Governor shall appoint the UCO President.  The UCO President shall serve 
at the pleasure of the appointing entity and shall be an ex officio member of the Regents. 

(f) Although UCO is an online university, some courses may require the student to be 
physically present in a lab or academic setting.  UCO is authorized to teach and deliver lab 

segments of classes offline and - notwithstanding paragraph (2) of subdivision. (b) - in such 
cases the UCO lab professor shall dictate the lab's schedule and pace.  As student demand 
is identified for such labs, the UCO President shall contract with other entities, public or 
private, local to the students, as necessary, to meet this demand.  UCO may require tests to 
be proctored, offline, in a physical setting.  As student demand for proctoring is identified, 
the UCO President may contract with other entities, public or private, local to the student 
to meet this demand.  Labs and proctoring are student costs. 

(g).  Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of subdivision (b ), the Regents and the UCO President 
shall charge out-of-state Division II students - in addition to tuition -- out-of-state Division 
II student fees.  The UCO President shall maximize these out-of-state Division II student 
fees.  The UCO President shall use all out-of-state Division II student fee revenues to fund: 
merit based in-state Division II student scholarships; UCO, UC, CSU, and CCC student 
food pantries; need based in-state student housing.  The UCO President shall:  devise a 
merit based in-state Division II student scholarship program; make reciprocal agreements 
with UC, CSU, and CCC student food pantries; and devise a need based in-state student 
housing plan to apply such revenues. 

(h).  Once approved by the voters the Treasurer shall issue the appropriate bonds in an 
appropriate amount to fund UCO in its entirety.  UCO shall repay these bonds from the 
tuition received.
